            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AS in all Ages it hath been Satan's Deſign to Blind the Minds of Men, even from our firſt Parents, whom he had ſoon rockt into a dead ſleep, with all their Poſterity, in which they had lyen till now, had not Chriſt awakened them: So ever ſince, and more Eminently in the laſt Times is he ſo Employed, all things concurring to the Accompliſhment of his Deſign. The World, which hath Ordinarily been a pricking Bryar, by that means preventing ſome Mens Sleeping, hath been turned into a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l the Beſt have ſlumbred, and the moſt are faſt aſleep; which hath ever been Dangerous, but now more than ever. Therefore the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted to Deſtroy the works of the Devil, hath Knocked at ſuch ſleepers Doors, by his awakening Providences, and by his Servants the Proph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s, Riſing up early, and ſending them. But now the danger of ſleepi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g unto Death is ſo great, that he ſends forth a Cryer at Midnight, to prevent the Ruine that would o're-whelm thoſe Sleepers by the Morning.</p>
            <p>This is the Critical Hour, and the laſt Application; thoſe that do not then Recover, periſh for ever. Were we ſenſible of the preſent Danger of ſuch a Nature, we ſhould not be Offended at plain dealing.</p>
            <p>The following Diſcourſe (which the Providence of God gave me with others an Opportunity to Hear) is of ſuch a Nature: The Inſtrument by whom this Truth was ſounded forth, being firſt ſent to awaken others now ſleeps in Jeſus; who willing that all Men ſhould come to the knowledge of the Truth, hath by his Providence Ordered the ſurviving of this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, that ſo it may come to their hands who had not an Opportunity, nor (poſſibly) an Heart to Receive it from the Speakers Lips. It was Joy to me to hear of its being Printed, though I do expect as Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did, ſo his moſt Material Truths will meet with hard <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage in the World. The Foundation and Corner-ſtone, which God lays in <hi>Sion,</hi> becomes a ſtone of ſtumbling to the Men of <hi>Judah</hi> (being Rejected of their Builders) yet nevertheleſs precious to them that believe. 'Tis Dangerous not to Believe the Truth, much more to be Offended at it. The Good Lord prevent Sorrow upon either Account.</p>
            <p>Receive nothing for Truth, without a Touch-ſtone: We do not onely Tell Gold after a Brother, but heretofore when Men were more Exact, did Weigh it alſo with Gold Weights, which then were wont to be in Readineſs
<pb facs="tcp:50213:3"/> with them, differing from thoſe by which baſer things were Weighed. So alſo is utmoſt Holy Curioſity Commendable in Weigihng Truth, onely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

            <p>And if ſomething be hard to be <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtood, be not Haſty to Reject at, much leſs the whole for the ſake of it; the Fault may poſſibly be in thine Eye, and not in the Object; we Live under a Diſpenſation wherein the fine Gold, or Goſpel-Grace is changed, and become Dim, as well as Lamps going out. The Difference between Wiſe and Fooliſh Virgins is not ſo eaſily diſcerned, ſave by ſearching the Veſſels, which this ſerves unto, and Gold will loſe nothing by being Rubbed; nor can Fooliſh Virgins be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by having the Emptineſs of their Veſſels diſcovered, whilſt Oyl is to be bought: <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, to every Purpoſe there is Time and Judgment, therefore the Miſery of Man is great, who wanteth Judgment, to know the Time appointed to his purpoſe. Every Profeſſor will one day know this Truth, which yet will not prevent theri Miſery, ſave by the timelineſs of ſuch Knowledge. It was the great Aggravation of <hi>Jeruſalem's</hi> ſin and ſorrow, that ſhe did not know (even in that her Day) the things that did Concern her Peace, which therefore are hid from her eyes ever ſince; as we may well expect it will be with thoſe Fooliſh Virgins, againſt whom (for the ſame Reaſon) Chriſt will ſhut his Door.</p>
            <p>I knew not what would be greater Rejoycing to me than to ſee Chriſt in his Truths and Intereſts advanced in mine own and others Hearts, to the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing of that Ignorance and prejudice that hath with-ſtood the Receiving of the Truth in Love, wherein we might have been eſtabliſhed, and not ſo Subject to be blown to and fro by the Tempters Wind, as at this Day. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out at Midnight is attended with many Difficulties, but when once entred into Chriſt's Bride-Chamber, they will be no more Remembred, nor will there be any cauſe of Repenting that Labour when they ſhall hear others Knock, and Cry in vain without, which God prevent being our Portion, by a Timely and effectual Grafting into the true Olive-tree, that ſo this Oyl of Grace and Light may never fail, ſo an Entrance ſhall be Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred into the Everlaſting Kingdom of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which is the Marriage-Supper of the Lamb, to which the Called are pronounced Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; untill when, Fellowſhip with this Teſtimony is Acknowledged a good Heritage, beſtowed by the Lord on a very <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nworthy Creature,</p>

               <p>And thus we read of Chriſts Coming to Judge the Earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96. 13. as he will do, when the ſeventh Trumpet ſoundeth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 15. 18. or when the Ark is (in the Temple Opened) to be ſeen, <hi>v.</hi> 19. which Temple is not in <hi>John</hi>'s New <hi>Jeruſalem, Rev.</hi> 21. 22. or at that Time, when Chriſt will come in Perſon; and ſo by Conſequence, the Lord will come to Judge (and in theſe latter days) before his Perſonal or Proper Coming at the laſt; or while the Ark and Tabernacle; or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (clear Types of Inſtituted Worſhip) are in Being; and therefore thoſe very words, <hi>Pſal</hi> 96. 13. are a part of that Song, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 33. which <hi>David</hi> Compoſed that Day, <hi>v.</hi> 7. in which he did remove the Ark, <hi>v.</hi> 1. Eſpecially ſince in the following <hi>Pſalm,</hi> (or <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97. which is but an Appendix to this former, or <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96.) God biddeth all the gods (or Men and Angels) to worſhip Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97. 7. when he ſhall bring in <hi>Again</hi> the firſt begotten into the World, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 6. (for ſo the <hi>Greek</hi> there is to be rendred,) which plainly hinteth Chriſt's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to come <hi>Again</hi> before his ſecond Perſonal Coming; or while the Ark (or Inſtituted worſhip) is abiding, and when it ſhall be ſet in a New Tent, which <hi>David</hi> (or Chriſt) hath pitched for it, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 1. in his own City, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 29.</p>
               <p>And which Precurſory Coming (alſo) might be further Argued, from Chriſt's being ſaid to Reign, together with the Seventh Trumpet's ſounding, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 15. who therefore muſt needs come, at ſuch a time,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50213:4"/> and in ſome ſence, though not in Perſon, as at the firſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 32. and at the laſt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. for ſuch a purpoſe. An Earneſt of which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was in the days of <hi>Conſtantine, Rev.</hi> 12. 5. though but an Earneſt, in Compariſon of this.</p>
               <p>Yea, therefore we alſo read of Chriſt's Rejoycing as a Bridegroom, (which is more cloſe unto this preſent Parable of the Virgins) toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the full Redemption of his People, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62. 4, 5. which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy relateth (Laſtly) to the Literal <hi>Jews,</hi> and will compleatly be made good unto them at their laſt Converſion, before Chriſt's Perſonal Coming, as all confeſs: But in the mean time, their Promiſes will firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be fulfilled upon us, that ſo through our Mercy they may obtain Mercy, having loſt their Priority through unbelief, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 30, 31. From whence it followeth, that Chriſt will Come (as a Bridegroom) before his Perſonal Coming. And under that Conſideration ſhall I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue this Parable; although I dare not wholly exclude Chriſt's Perſonal Coming here, ſo far as it is Applicable thereunto, ſince every of his Comings are ſo like each unto other.</p>
               <p>This being Premiſed, the Obſervation from the firſt Verſe is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> In theſe latter days, (or a little before the Seventh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet's ſounding) the Kingdom of Heaven ſhall be likened unto Ten Virgins, which took their Lamps, and went forth to meet the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom.</p>
               <p>In the Proſecution of which Point, ſome things will need to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into, which are as followeth.</p>

Nor can an Earthly Kingdom give more content than he, in whom the ſulneſs of all things dwelleth, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 19. who alſo is the hope of Glory, <hi>v.</hi> 27.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thereby are ſometimes meant, all manner of Goſpel-Truths, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Preaching of them. As when the Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a Grain of Muſtard-ſeed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 31. eſpecially ſome kind of Truths, <hi>viz.</hi> The Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>v.</hi> 11. And therefore the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were ſaid to ſhut up the Kingdom of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven againſt Men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 13. becauſe they kept them from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſuch Truths, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 52. The Publication whereof is alſo called by that Name; as when the Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a Net, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 47. which is moſt fitly applicable unto Preaching, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 9. And as theſe things lead unto the Kingdom of Heaven, ſo is there a Kingly and Heavenly Authority ſtampt upon them, when du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly managed, which maketh this to be their proper Name.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thereby is ſometimes meant a viſible Goſpel-Church; as when Chriſt gave to <hi>Peter</hi> (in the Name of others) the Keys of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 19. Or all Church-Power, as it is explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 17, 18. And into which Kingdom of Heaven none have a right to enter, but they whoſe Righteouſneſs is more than <hi>Phariſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> Mat. 5. 20.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Becauſe it is Governed by a King, as Chriſt is called, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 2. whoſe Miniſtration that of the Goſpel is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. Chriſt's Spiritual Government is Monarchical, which doth admit of no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions; and therefore there is but one Law giver, <hi>James</hi> 4. 12. Nor will true Saints make mention of any other, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 13. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Saints (as ſuch) owe no Obedience unto Man, in Goſpel-matters, ſave as this King's Authority is produced. What an Arch-Traitor is the Man of ſin, who dareth to Prohibit or Impoſe, in ſuch a Caſe, without Chriſt's leave? The Nations are for a Kingly Form among themſelves, who yet therein Oppoſe the Sons of <hi>Sion,</hi> but all in vain, and to their own Deſtruction, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>2. Becauſe this Kingdom is Diſtinct from any other, as in all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of that Nature. <hi>Moſes</hi> hath no Command in Chriſt's own Houſe; and therefore his bare Authority in (Goſpel-times) is no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Plea.

                     </gap>t, and therefore in their days, the Temple was within the City, or Temporal and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Juriſdiction were then confounded: But in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s laſt Viſion, (relating to the Second Temple in Goſpel-times) the Temple or Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is without the City, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 45. 1, 2. compared with <hi>Ezek.</hi> 48. 15. To hint the difference of thoſe Dominions, which then will be made vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Men may Create their Civil Rulers, (at leaſt till ſuch a time,) but cannot thereby make them to have Power in another's Kingdom, which all confeſs, ſave in Relation to the Right of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>3. Becauſe it is made up of divers Spirits, as every Kingdom is; wherein ſome Men are Righteous and others Wicked. A Family may be more pure than can be expected in a Kingdom. And therefore this more Refined Kingdom (here) is diſtributed into Wiſe and Fooliſh Virgins. Subjection unto Chriſt, doth not ſufficiently evince a ſame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Diſpoſition; and the Children of this Kingdom may be caſt out of that which is to come, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 11, 12. There are a ſort of baſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, who yet may carry it fairly, untill a Temptation cometh, and then they ſhew themſelves. They who are counted the beſt and upright, may yet prove very bad upon a Tryal, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>4. Becauſe the ſame Laws do bind all ſorts of Perſons, within the Compaſs of ſuch a Juriſdiction. There is not one Law for Great Ones, and another for others; in this (no more than in any other) Kingdom. If this were duly weighed, ſome would not dare to give themſelves a Diſpenſation, whilſt they are opening the Law to others. Nor would
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50213:6"/> ſome others fondly think, that ſuch a Duty is not incumbent upon them, unleſs they know it, and have it ſet upon their Hearts. The Fooliſh Virgins are not excuſed, though wanting Oyl or Light; becauſe they and the Wiſe Live in one Kingdom, whoſe common Laws do equally Oblige them both.</p>
                  <p>5. Becauſe it is not eaſily ſhaken or Removed, which holdeth true, with reference unto any Kingdom; but eminently here, as <hi>Paul</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 28. Churches may fail, and many Revolutions may occurr, but yet the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel is abiding. This Kingdom ſubverted that of Old, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 27. but never will be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by it: And therefore the Reſtauration of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, (upon the Jews Converſion) and of an Adamitical State (or Legal Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) in <hi>John</hi>'s New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> are but ſome Men's un-Scriptural Fancies. None will be ever ſaveable, but by a Goſpel Faith and Duty, or through an Intereſt in the Everlaſting Covenant.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Becauſe it is not of this World, but of a more ſublimated or Heavenly Riſe. <hi>Moſes</hi> his Miniſtration is called worldly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 1. becauſe it was the ſame (for kind) with <hi>Adam</hi>'s, whoſe Make was Earthly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 47. But Chriſt's Miniſtration is like himſelf, who is the Lord from Heaven, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 47. How ſad is their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, by whom the Diſpenſations of Grace and Nature are Confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The good of Nature will never prove Goſpel-Holineſs; nor is the difference between them onely Gradual, but alſo in point of Kind (as in Relation to God's thoughts and ours, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 9.) elſe Earthly and Heavenly Priviledges may alſo be as well Confounded.</p>
                  <p>2. Becauſe what is contained under it, is at the preſent (moſtly) of a more Spiritual and inviſible Nature, as Heavenly things yet are, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 18. He muſt have more than an Eye of Fleſh, who can diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between the Wiſe and Fooliſh Virgins. <hi>Moſes</hi> Tranſgreſſors were eaſily to be Convicted, but proper Goſpel-ſins are of a more My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious Nature. The Weapons of <hi>Paul</hi>'s warfare were wholly Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. which under the Law were moſtly Carnal, conſiſting of Man's coercive power in Religious Matters. Legal Rewards and Threats were (ſave in ſhadows) altogether Temporal; but Goſpel-Threats and Promiſes are chiefly Spiritual and Eternal.</p>
                  <p>3. Becauſe it leadeth unto Heaven ſtrictly taken, which never was, nor will be done by any other Diſpenſation. <hi>Moſes</hi> did onely under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for Earthly Bleſſings, but doth not ſpeak one word of Heaven, ſave
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50213:6"/> in a way of Type and Figure, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 24. And ſinleſs <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould onely have Lived alway upon Earth, but not have been Tranſlated thence to Heaven, by vertue of his preſent Covenant. Whereas this Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the Goſpel doth rebound fallen Man (beyond whence <hi>Adam</hi> fell) into a ſtate of Heavenly Glory. Oh what a Price is put into their hand, who Live there-under! Such may now walk from Earth to Heaven, as from one Room into another, can they but follow Chriſt, before the Partition-door between thoſe Rooms is ſhut.</p>
                  <p>4. Becauſe it is exceeding Glorious, as are all Heavenly things. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> his Miniſtration was very dark, but here the Veil is done away, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 14. That was the Diſpenſation of a Servant onely, This of a Son, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 5, 6. That was to be done away, but This remaineth, which therefore is much more Glorious, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11. That left poor Souls without a change; but This Transforms thoſe under it, from Glory unto Glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. Here are more Glorious Saints, and Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Priviledges, and Duties, and Diſcoveries, than generally were of Old.

                  <p>5. Becauſe a Fall from hence is moſt Deſtructive, as that from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven cannot but be. The wicked Angels are moſt ſadly broken, becauſe they fell from Heaven; and <hi>Capernaum</hi> was brought down to Hell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſometimes exalted unto Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 23.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe of the Reſemblance between them and Virgins, in the Letter.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Virgins are generally a Younger ſort of Perſons; and ſuch are theſe, both in a Literal and Myſtical ſence. This Diſpenſation relateth unto a turn of things, ſuch as hath been of later Years, in theſe our Days: Now, Aged Trees will not ſo eaſily bend, or bear a Tranſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and it is God alone, who can perſwade the Heart of <hi>Japhet,</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:50213:7"/> to dwell in the Tents of <hi>Shem; Gen.</hi> 9. 27. his Younger Brother, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. 21. Yea, therefore ſuch are Myſtically Younger alſo, becauſe of thoſe later Diſcoveries which are embraced by them. Both which have been abundantly exemplified, in our firſt goers forth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Virgins are weak enough, the wiſeſt of them, much more the Fooliſh ones; and ſuch are theſe Profeſſors. They are apt to be more aſhamed of being ſeen in a dirty dreſs, than otherwiſe they would be, in a Corner; 'tis not ſins being in them, but its being ſeen, that is moſt troubleſome. They are Ambitious of going Fine, although unable to maintain that outward bravery, in point of pretending unto Grace and Peace, ſuppoſing elſe it would be to their ſhame. They will be in the Faſhion, becauſe it is the Faſhion, and not becauſe 'tis Modeſt or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient; as many did ſometimes own Chriſts Kingly Intereſt, ſo long as it was in Faſhion, who ſince have laid it quite aſide. They will not Actually be defiled, but yet will dally with ſome leſs Temptations. They look to be Entreated, with reference unto the moſt deſirable Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, although its Loſs be thereby hazarded.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Virgins will be, and do delight in one anothers Company, and ſo do theſe, untill there be ſome violent ſeparation, or grievous diſcord. Next unto Chriſt, ſincere Profeſſors are moſt delighted each in other, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 3. Yea, ſuch are for Communion with others alſo, whilſt undiſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as Sheep will feed with Goats, untill the Shepherd part them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 23. And more refined Hypocrites will leave the World, to walk with wiſer Virgins than themſelves; eſpecially if five of ſuch to five ſincere ones, as in this Parable. Some Fooliſh Virgins (o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="4">4. Virgins are viſibly undefiled, and ſuch are theſe; at leaſt, with reference unto more groſs Pollutions. They may have wanton hearts, and eyes, and habits, but are not commonly called Adultereſſes, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with others. Theſe are aſhamed of an Harlots Company, and cannot bear to be defamed with her Name or filthineſs. Whatever they have ſometimes been, they now will Covenant againſt all manner of Whoriſh Antichriſtianiſm. And with Reſpect unto their Carriage other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways; ſuch are for Purity, both in Communion and Converſation, which maketh them to be accounted Virgins, untill they be out-ſtript by others, or do degenerate.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Virgins are wont at Marriages to be the Bride's Companions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 14. &amp; for her ſake they are the Bridegroom's Friends. The wiſeſt have too much Mercenarineſs in their Affections; but yet they have a true

What Zeal hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt for Chriſt, of later Years, becauſe the Bridegroom's Coming was then expected?

Now, if this Bride be Chriſts, let us acknowledge all that Glory to be his; and let not <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples murmure at <hi>John</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe: and let us not fall too much in Love with another's Bride, but let our Rejoycing then be chiefly for the Bridegroom's ſake, <hi>John</hi> 3. 29.</p>
                  <p>2. Becauſe this is the time of Marriage, or elſe one's being onely made ſure to ſuch a Woman, is not enough to make an Actual Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom.

                  <p>3. Becauſe the manner of his Coming then, will be like that of a Bridegroom.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Very Glorious. A Bridegroom is deck'd with Ornaments. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 10. and ſo are his Friends and Followers.

They did conclude, the Bridegroom's Coming would be with Clouds and Darkneſs, which put them upon this Proviſion. Indeed the Day of his Salvation is as a Lamp that burneth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62. 1. But yet this Day beginneth with an Evening, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14. 7. At leaſt-wiſe, in point of clear Diſcerning; as hath been to be Obſerved in our Times, when there was firſt a going out, which all our Profeſſing Virgins did ſeeem to Underſtand at ſuch a time. Now, this going forth to meet him, may be Interpreted three ways.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:50213:8"/> 1. As an Evidence of Longing to behold him with the firſt; thus did the <hi>Jews</hi> go out to <hi>John,</hi> Mat. 11. 9. And <hi>Balaam</hi> to meet the Lord, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23. 15. Yea, thus God Meeteth him that Rejoyceth, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Righteouſneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. 5. And thus all ſorts of Virgins were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very deſirous to ſee the Bridegroom, who therefore could not ſtay untill he came, but muſt go out to meet him. How did the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, Preſſes, and Occaſional Diſcourſes (then) abound with canvaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Tinie Truths and Duties, to furniſh themſelves with Light into their way. They who Delight in Chriſt, cannot but ſeek him alſo, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 1. with reference unto his Perſon, Truths, and Intereſts; and happy is that Soul, who is Admitted to behold this Sun at its firſt Riſe. This vehemency of Deſire, is from the wiſer Virgins Judgment, and from the others Ignorance of the Nature of his Appearing, <hi>Amos</hi> 5. 18.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As a ſignal of that Reſpect which they have for him. Thus <hi>Lot</hi> went out to meet the Angels, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 1. And <hi>Joſeph</hi> to meet his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Gen.</hi> 46. 29. And <hi>Solomon</hi> his Mother, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 19. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a Perſon's ſtanding till others come to him, doth manifeſt his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteem of them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. 19. Chriſt is the deſerving Object of all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, eſpecially when he cometh as a Bridegroom, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 7. which Virgins know, who therefore then go out to meet him. Wiſe Virgins ſaw the Glory of his firſt Appearance, <hi>John</hi> 1. 14. but all ſhall ſee that of his Second Coming, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 30. which at this Time the Fooliſh Virgins had a Glympſe of; and therefore they alſo are gone forth to meet him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As this their going out, doth intimate, what is Requ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>red there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As one goeth out of his Private Houſe into the open ſtreets; or with Reſpect to that more Publick Teſtimony on Chriſts behalf, at ſuch a Time. This was the caſe of all our Virgins, who did of Old bear Witneſs to the Truths of Chriſt, but onely in their private Houſes; whereas a Spirit of boldneſs appeared in them afterwards; So as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare againſt the whole of (then known) Antichri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſm, yea, in the Face of utmoſt Danger. If any then ſhould but have told them, how they would after run into their holes again, (as they have generally done) their Anſwer would have been like that of <hi>Hazael</hi>'s to <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 13.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. With Reference unto their going out of Ancient Myſtical Houſes, which muſt be left behind, by thoſe, who think to meet the Bridegroom. And thus did all our Virgins at ſuch a Time. Some then went out of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50213:9"/> their former way of National Worſhip, and Church-Government: Others went out of the Ancient National Church-State: And though ſome of them were faſtned by a Rope unto thoſe Houſes ſtill, which ſince hath drawn them back again; yet others were wholly looſened from them, which is their Mercy. Nor were they likely to wear the Bridegroom's Favours (in caſe he had then come) without theſe To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of their Virginity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. With Reference unto one's outward Intereſt, which muſt be gone out of alſo; and whereupon the other two depend. The leaſt Advance Chriſt-ward, is into Dirty, Deep, and Dangerous ways at firſt; and the Mother of Harlots will both brawl and fight, when call'd an Whore, or when her Dreſs hath any dirt caſt on it. And in this Sence, there was a going forth by all our Virgins. Some loſt their Goods and Lives, and all did run the hazard of a Doubtful Caſe, with utmoſt Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They did run well, had they but been as good at Length; as they were at Hand; and half that Self-denying Courage now, might have procured their Admiſſion into the Bridegroom's Chamber, at his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So much for the Explication: The Application followeth. And ſo</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. From that word <hi>[THEN]</hi> we have hinted to us, both at what time it will be thus, and what will be at ſuch a time. It hath been formerly Declared, what ſpecial Time is here referred unto, <hi>viz.</hi> That which is nigh unto the Seventh Trumpets Sounding: And then this Parable of the Virgins (I humbly ſuppoſe) will properly be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled. And when the Generality of Profeſſors do thus go forth, we may conclude from thence, what Diſpenſation we are haſtning under. Now, we have plainly ſeen (in theſe our days) that going out to meet the Bridegroom, ſuch as hath not been to be ſeen in former Ages, which giveth us to gheſs at leaſt, where we now are, in this dark Seaſon.</p>
                  <p>2. Poor Fooliſh Virgins may ſometimes poſſibly go forth (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the wiſe) to meet the Bridegroom. So it is here fore-told, and hath been verified, or at the leaſt, exemplified. Nor can I (as ſome others) think, this going forth was from a ſinful haſtineſs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there was no voyce of a Cry requiring it, as afterwards; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there was not any ſuch need at firſt, becauſe that Duty was Then more Obvious, the Spirits more couragious, and their encouragements greater, than at the ſecond time. From whence is hinted, what little cauſe Men had to count thoſe real Saints, who then went forth.</p>
                  <p>3. Chriſt thinks none worthy to be called Profeſſors, ſave onely Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins; under which Title here he comprehendeth all the Profeſſors of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50213:9"/> ſuch a time. From whence we may be able to Judge, concerning the viſibility of their Spiritual State, who are not unpolluted Virgins. Some have been apt to call thoſe Brethren, who ſtill continued in their ſin or Antichriſtianiſm, meerly becauſe of their Parts and Moral Vertues: But Chriſt calls her the Mother of Harlots, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 5. who was Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed in Purple, <hi>v.</hi> 4. which was a Tabernacle Colour. Profeſſors may be Hypocrites, but yet they muſt be Virgins; or undefiled ones. But then</p>

Time was, when Polygamy was not accounted Scandalous, nor Prelaty Antichriſtian; but many ſuch things are now enough to cloud the viſibility of Saint-ſhip, which heretofore have been more gently cenſured. Nor muſt I inſtance now in any of the Virgins Properties, ſave what are good and Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By way of Reſolution. And ſo Profeſſors may be known by their reſembling Virgins in the Letter, in theſe Reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Virgins are very Lovely, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 2. 2. And Deſirable, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62. 5. Which doth expoſe them unto Temptations, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 2. Such are Chriſt's Spouſes in Reality, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 8. and 4. 7. and 6. 10. Such are all viſible Saints in outward ſhew. They have black Hoods or Masks of outward Sufferings, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 14. But otherwiſe their Countenance is very comely, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 14. Such are at a further diſtance from this world's tanning Sun, and have the Advantage of Adorning Garments; yea, even the Fooliſh Virgins ſhine through the Reflection of others beams upon them, with whom they do Converſe. Sinners are foul <hi>Egyptians,</hi> compared with <hi>Sarah,</hi> who therefore was moſt ſorely Tempted, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 14, 15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Virgin will not be Hyred to play the Harlot, till firſt ſhe ceaſeth to be (in Heart) a Virgin. We Read of the Hyre of an Whore, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 18. Yea, there are ſome Whores without Reward, <hi>Ezek</hi> 16. 34. But Virgins (both in the Letter and Myſtery) prefer this Chaſtity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the greateſt Gifts. 'Tis not the Pleaſure or Profit of ſuch a ſin that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50213:10"/> will entice unto ſo groſs an Act; though leſſer failings may be too much indulged. Thoſe are abuſively Sir-named Profeſſors, who can comply with what hath been confeſſed to be Antichriſtianiſm; or ſeem to make no Conſcience of Lying, Railing, Cheating, and the like; which are againſt the Light of Nature, and Anſwer unto groſs Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Virgins will do their utmoſt to withſtand defilement: Such will firſt Argue with the Tempter, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did with his Miſtreſs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 7, 8, 9. If that prevail not, ſuch then will ſtruggle, as <hi>Tamar</hi> did with <hi>Amnon,</hi> but that he was the ſtronger, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 14. And in that caſe, ſuch will cry out for help, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. 27. And more eſpecially unto the Lord, as <hi>David</hi> did, when many roſe up againſt him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3. 1. 4. Thoſe are not viſible Saints, who make a faint Reſiſtance, when fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with Temptations of an Whoriſh Nature. And though poor Literal Virgins may be enforced, yet can there be no Myſtical defiling, without the Party's will; yea, God would help, if heartily cryed unto, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29. 13.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A Virgin will not yield, in ſuch a caſe, whatever Loſs or Danger may enſue thereon. <hi>Joſeph</hi> would rather loſe his Garment, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 12. and run the hazard of his Place and Liberty, <hi>v.</hi> 20. than give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto his Whoriſh Miſtreſs. As viſible Saints will not be won by hopes of Gain, ſo neither by the fear of Suffering, to turn Adultereſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, in a Spiritual or Moral ſence. Thoſe ought not to be called Virgins, who do prefer their Liberty, Eſtate, or Life before their Chaſtity; the loſs whereof is lookt upon (by Real Virgins) to be the greateſt Suffering, and ſo it is, both in it ſelf, and as it is ſo great a ſin, which is indeed the onely Suffering to be avoided, in Compariſon.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Virgins are careful to avoid Debauched Company. Such know that wholeſome Counſel, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 8. Not to come nigh the Door of an Harlots Houſe; and how poor <hi>Dinah</hi> was deſloured, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34. 1, 2. And what a pleaſing ſin unto the Fleſh this is, together with the force of Importunity and Opportunity upon a Treacherous Heart; and how it may be juſt with God, to leave ſuch Dalliers unto themſelves: All which are cogent with them, to keep out of the Tempter's Juriſdiction. The Fooliſh Virgins here, Converſed onely with themſelves, and with the Wiſe. Thoſe are not viſible Saints, who make no matter of being in the Devil's way, or of unneceſſary Communion with Enticers of this Nature, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 10.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Virgins will not put on an Harlots Dreſs. We Read of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire of an Harlot, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 10. which honeſt Women will not be clothed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50213:10"/> with, though never ſo Rich; yea, though it might keep off ſome pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Cold. Our late Profeſſors were very Curious in that Reſpect; not wearing their former Garments of Diſtinction, nor uſing the beſt Set-Form of Prayer that ever was, becauſe theſe were accounted Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Habits: and their return unto ſuch things again, hath very much blemiſhed their Virgin-Reputation. A Gentleman thinks ſcorn to have an Ivy-buſh hung at his Door; and viſible Saints will thun appearances of evil, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 22. eſpecially when of ſo groſs a Nature, by which they may be known from others.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Virgins are very neat, and ſtudious of their Beauty. <hi>Can a Maid forget her Ornaments,</hi> Jer. 2. 32? Nor will a Spouſe walk out without her Veil, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 7. Such are aſhamed to be ſeen undreſt; and what they wear is very clean; yea, they are for the fineſt ſtuff, and neweſt Faſhion, with Sobriety. Their Looking-Glaſſes are of daily Uſe, nor will they be Offended, if Friendly told of any thing amiſs about them; and would have every part of their Attire in its due place and Order. Such will waſh oft, and carefully avoid what doth defile them; and keep within doors, for fear of being Sun-burnt. Thoſe are no viſible Saints, who are not very Accurate, Compared with the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Virgins are in the beſt Capacity of caring for the things of God, becauſe diſcharged from other Cares; which is accordingly improved by Spiritual Virgins, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 34. Poor Carnal Creatures are Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried unto the World, whoſe care is therefore how to pleaſe that Hus<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>band, ſuppoſing it to be their Duty, becauſe they have no Faith in God, nor Love for ought but <hi>Mammon.</hi> But viſible Saints have had a taſte of better things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 5. and can Adventure more upon the Promiſe, which doth a little ſublimate their Spirits and Affections. A Covetous Profeſſor ſhould not be kept in others Company, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Virgins are wont to ſort together.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Virgins are Noted for their comely ſilence; as being to be ſeen, but ſeldom heard: Whereas an Harlots voyce is Loud, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 10, 11. They who have leaſt in Heart, are uſually moſt full of Tongue; but deepeſt Waters make the ſmalleſt noyſe. And though Saints are not for an Humorous ſilence, yet is their ſpeech more ſparing, eſpecially in ſuch like Caſes, as theſe which follow. Saints will not Prate againſt the Truth, nor will they Boaſt of what they are, nor do they place the main of Duty in much ſpeaking, nor do they reliſh vain Diſcourſe, or love to ſpeak themſelves, but are more ſwift to hear. <hi>A Wiſe Man ſpares his words,</hi> Prov. 17. 27. And Fooliſh Virgins may Learn that piece of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50213:11"/> Heavenly Breeding, by being in the others Company. The very ſpeech of over-talkative Profeſſors doth bewray them.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Virgins are mighty apt to bluſh, upon the leaſt Occaſion; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as an Whores <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Some cannot Bluſh, though guilty of Abominations, which is a dreadful Sign, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 15.

Wiſdom is chiefly ſeated in the Underſtanding, or Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Faculty, and doth conſiſt in Light or Knowledge, and ſo doth Grace, which therefore is Reſembled by it. The New Man is renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Knowledge, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10. And Grace is called the Law of the Mind, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23. Whilſt ſin is oft-times called Darkneſs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 18. and 5. 8. Which meerly being Privative, doth therefore need no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Cauſe; and conſequently there's no Neceſſity, that either God ſhould be its Author, or that the Soul (which is its Subject) ſhould be by Natural Generation (upon the one of which Rocks many have run, from un-acquaintance with ſin's proper Notion) ſince ſin is nothing but the Iſſue of an Active Spirit, devoid of Light, which then cannot but err or ſtumble, <hi>John</hi> 11. 10.</p>
                  <p>2. Wiſdom (or Knowledge) is that, wherein the Image of God conſiſteth, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10.

(with <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 34.) Is therefore called the Image of his Perſon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. Which is the onely Image of God, now owned by him, in a Moral ſence; ſo that a Godly wiſe Man is now the onely God-like Man, whereas the Fooliſh ſinner is like unto the Devil, <hi>John</hi> 8. 44. who is Reſembled by that Fooliſh Woman, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9. 13.

All which is true concerning Grace, which therefore is fitly called Wiſdom. Grace is that Better part, or One thing Needful, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 41, 42. and will be generally ſo accounted, though now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned. Saints would not loſe their Graces for all the World. God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is profitable for all things, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8.

                  <p>4. Wiſdom is very Rare, and ſo is Goſpel-Grace. Great men are not always wiſe, nor yet the Aged, <hi>Job</hi> 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And wiſdom was far from <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> himſelf, when he ſaid, <hi>I will be Wiſe,</hi> Eccl. 7. 23. The whole world doth lye in wickedneſs, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 19.

Some call their Vices Vertues; and moſt Men count that Spiritual, which is but meerly Animal, or Natural, becauſe they judge of Actions and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by their Matter onely: according to which Rule, the Sacred Fire upon the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Altar might have been counted Common.</p>
                  <p>5. Wiſdom is chiefly ſelf-advantaging, and ſo is Grace. If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9. 12. Such may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to themſelves, though not to God, <hi>Job</hi> 22. 2. He therefore loveth his own Soul, who getteth wiſdom, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 8. 'Tis true, good works are alſo Profitable unto others, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 8. But as ſelf-gain is far the greateſt, ſo Grace (as Grace) doth onely benefit the Soul it ſelf. And though one's ſtrength may help another, without his will, yet wiſdom is not Effectual to Preſerve, or Guide, ſave him in whom it is. Gifts may more profit others than ones ſelf, but Grace leaves not its Owner deſtitute of what it gives to others.</p>
                  <p>6. A little Folly doth prejudice him very much, who is reputed wiſe; as ſweeteſt Oyntments are moſt unſavoury, in Caſe dead Flyes be in them, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10. 1. And ſo it is with Goſpel-Grace. A dirty Swine is not ſo much obſerved as a Dirty Sheep; nor ſin in any, ſo much as in the Saints, becauſe their Linnen is clean and white, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 8. which maketh ſpots to be the more conſpicuous. Degenerating Saints are moſt abominable, as Animal parts and Spirits Putrified (becauſe they are the beſt) are moſt Offenſive. Let not a wiſe man therefore utter
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50213:12"/> vanity, whatever others do, <hi>Job</hi> 15. 2. Remembring how wicked ones Blaſphemed when <hi>David</hi> fell, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 14. becauſe he had a name for wiſdom.</p>

And though ſome more Diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Character (than thoſe which follow) might poſſibly be produced, in caſe the buſineſs were purſued at large; yet is my preſent enquiry bounded by this Metaphor of Wiſdom, and what the Scripture ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto the point in hand, under that ſpecial and peculiar conſideration. Therefore let not the expectations of any be over-large, ſince I am now under a double Limitation, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, Of holding to this ſingle word of Wiſdom; and Secondly, Of ſhewing rather, who are Fooliſh, or Graceleſs Perſons, than who may (Peremptorily) be termed Wiſe; at leaſt, with reference unto the Greater part of mine enſuing Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters.</p>

But otherwiſe, it is a ſport to Fools to be miſchievous, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 23. And an abomination to depart from Evil, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 19. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as

                  <p n="3">3. Wiſe men are very circumſpect (or Accurate) in their walking, which Fools are not, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 15. Poor Fooliſh Virgins make light of Dallying with Temptations, and mock at ſomething which is a ſin, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 9. In caſe their Copy by not blotted, Hair-ſtrokes are not much heeded in their writing. Whereas a Goſpel-Saint is very curious, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vain Thoughts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 113.

                  <p n="4">4. Wiſe ones are for the Building of their Houſe, or for the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of what they have begun; but Fooliſh Perſons are for the pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of their own building, with their own Hands, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 1. Theſe Fooliſh Virgins went out at firſt, but failed the ſecond time, and ſo loſt all their Labour. And therefore with what Face can ſome men Glory in a former Teſtimony for that Truth, from whence they have ſince fallen? Such ſeem to be Chriſt's Houſe at preſent, but do not prove ſo in the Iſſue, becauſe they hold not out untill the End, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 6.

A wiſe man ſeeketh knowledge, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 15. and doth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive it, when brought unto him: Such know its worth, and that it lyeth low, as Silver doth; which putteth them upon a ſuitable ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 4.

Some things are left more dark in the Scriptures, that ſtudious Saints might be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from ſluggiſh ſinners, whoſe Soul deſireth, and hath nothing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 4. How little is ſome kind of Knowledge ſearched after by the generality, who rather ſeem to be afraid of ſeeing that which haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardeth their worldly Intereſt, and thereby are evinced to be Fooliſh Virgins.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The wiſdom of the Prudent, is, to underſtand his way, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 8. and to look well unto his going, <hi>v.</hi> 15.

They are not under the Command of Major vote, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 13, 14. but are Redeemed from Traditions, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18. and have no Maſter, (or Leader of the way) ſave onely Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 10. Whereas the ſimple believeth every of ſome mens words, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 15. and it ſufficeth him, if others can make it out, with reference to what he Doeth, or doth Believe. The greateſt part (I fear) of late Profeſſors, may thus be proved to be Fooliſh Virgins.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Wiſe men are for the Reduction of what they know, unto the Rule of Practice; or for the ſhewing of their wiſdom by their works and Converſation, <hi>James</hi> 3. 13. The Doer of Chriſt's ſayings, is onely dignified with hat name of wiſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 24. whereas the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Hearer is called Fooliſh, <hi>v.</hi> 26. At what a rate will ſome men talk? Wherewith themſelves are fully ſatisfied, like ſilly Fools.

But Goſpel-Saints are not for empty Speculations, or the Diſcourſive part of Duty, or an impoſing upon others onely; by which their Heavenly wiſdom doth appear.</p>

And ſheep will run upon their Shepherd's whiſtle, before his Dog be ſent among them. Indeed ſome Fooliſh Virgins may bear to be Rebuked; but wiſer ones are by that means Reclaimed alſo, which others ſeldom are.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Wiſe men are firſt for Purity, and then for Peace, <hi>James</hi> 3. 17. whilſt others are afraid, leſt if Truths windows be too big, the Houſe of Peace will by that means be weakned; whereas it is a Duty to throw that Houſe out of Truth's window, rather than that its Light ſhould be Obſcured. The general out-cry at this day for Civil Peace, whatever becomes of Truth, doth but declare men to be Fooliſh. Whilſt <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> was for Peace and Truth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 39. 8. And all are bid to be for Truth and Peace, <hi>Zech.</hi> 8. 16. Moſt men endeavour onely to preſerve an Outward Union; but <hi>Paul</hi> was meerly for keeping the Spirit's Unity in the Bond of Peace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 3. Sinners would fain have Peace of Conſcience: but as there is no Peace unto the wicked, ſo Goſpel-Saints are for no Peace with ſin; but are for Purity of Conſcience firſt, and in the ſecond place, for Peace. Yea, this holds true, with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto the Peace of God; which though it be highly prized by the Godly wiſe, yet is Grace firſt deſired by them, and Peace in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 2.</p>

A Saint's Spiritual Fruits prevent his being over-full of Leaves, which Barren Trees do moſt abound with.

                     <hi>Fools promotion,</hi> Prov. 3. 35. Men hitherto have been admired, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their Natural or worldly wiſdom; but the time now draweth nigh, when God (or the appearance of his Grace) ſhall be for a Crown of Glory, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 5.

                  <p>2. Wiſdom is that which is moſt likely to Advance a Man into the Higheſt Place of Rule and Truſt. <hi>Joſeph</hi> was ſeen to be Diſcreet and Wiſe, and therefore <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſet him over all his Houſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. 39, 40. Fools have been uppermoſt, but ſhall be Servants to the wiſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 29. becauſe the King's Favour is towards a wiſe Servant, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 35. and he ſhall Rule over a Fooliſh Son, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 2. Grace hath the Promiſe of this Life alſo, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. which ſhall be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in due time, when wickedneſs ſhall be de-throned, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21. 25, 26.

But <hi>David</hi> will cut them off, and then the Saints Horn ſhall be exalted, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75. 10.</p>
                  <p>3. A wiſe Man knoweth hidden Myſteries, or the Interpretation of a thing, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8. 1. which is a great Advantage. Such Men ſhall ſee the Name (or Mind) of God, when he is crying to the City, by ſome ſignal Judgment, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. 9.

The Truth and Application of the Promiſes, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 9. together with the time of their Accompliſhment, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 10. As we would be moſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, ſo let us Labour to be moſt Holy; ſince theſe have that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to them, which is not known to others, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Wiſdom is better than ſtrength,</hi> Eccl. 9. 16. <hi>or Weapons of War, v.</hi> 18. both in a Defenſive and Offenſive way, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7. 12. 19. and 9. 15. Juſtice will be too many for the moſt United force of ſinners, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 21. but cannot hurt the weakeſt Saint for ever. Satan knew Chriſt and <hi>Paul,</hi> who were too hard for him; but he could overcome thoſe wicked Jews, when offering to adjure him, though in the Name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 13, 14, 15, 16. The words of the Wiſe are heard in quiet, more than the Cry (or utmoſt endeavours) of him that Ruleth among Fools, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9. 17. Some put their truſt in Moral Vertues, or Natural Tempers and Reſolutions; but Satan's fiery Darts will not be quenched with ſuch Scarfs and Feathers. Saints are the onely Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 37. becauſe they keep themſelves from being
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50213:17"/> touch'd by him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 18. Who leadeth others Captive, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26.</p>
                  <p>5. Mony may (in ſome caſes) be a Defence, as well as Wiſdom; but the Excellency of Knowledge is, that wiſdom giveth Life to them that have it, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7. 12. A Fooliſh Man is dead, as to his better part, <hi>viz.</hi> his Underſtanding; and Graceleſs Perſons are called Idols, <hi>Zech.</hi> 11. 17. in whom there is no Breath (or ſign of Life) at all, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 19. Yea, ſin is the ſaddeſt kind of Death that is, becauſe it is both Spiritual, and likely to be Eternal, and yet conſiſtent with the quickeſt ſenſe of higheſt Miſery. And if ſuch were not Dead indeed, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration would make them take faſt hold of Grace or Heavenly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and not to let it go, but keep it, becauſe it is their Life, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 13.</p>
                  <p>6. Wiſdom is of moſt uſe to others alſo; becauſe it makes moſt willing and moſt ſucceſsful, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 7. Men of a Lower Spirit are ſparing in their Communications, leſt others ſhould be as knowing as themſelves: But Grace is free to light a Greater Candle, though its own leſſer Lamp ſhould thereby be Eclipſed. Such alſo are likely to be moſt Succeſsful, becauſe they are moſt careful, and have the promiſe of Chriſt's Preſence with them. The words of the wiſe are Goads, and ſuch are careful to faſten their Nails, for fear of dropping out, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12. 11. And though a wicked man may poſſibly Convert another, yet is there no Promiſe for it, ſave unto thoſe, who do themſelves ſtand in God's Counſel, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 22. and winning Souls, or turning Men unto Righteouſneſs, is chiefly Attributed to the Godly wiſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 30. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 3.</p>
                  <p>7. Wiſdom is that which ſets out other things, and without which there's nothing that doth become. Wiſdom is good with an Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7. 11. not but that wiſdom (it ſelf) is good without it; onely an Inheritance is not elſe ſeemly: whereas the wiſe man's Riches are his Crown, becauſe of that Conjunction, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 24. Wherever the Branch (or Chriſt) doth grow, the Fruit of the Earth will there be Excellent and comely, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4. 2. as Earthen Veſſels are, when Tipt with Silver; wether we take that Earthly Fruit, for outward Bleſſings, or Moral Vertues, and Common Actions, or for a mean Deſcent relating to a Gracious Soul, whom every thing becometh, as Ordinary Garments do an handſom Body.</p>
                  <p>8. Folly doth Incapacitate a Man for that which he is apt to be am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of, and which nought elſe can fit him for, ſave onely wiſdom. All would have Joy, but yet delight doth not become a Fool, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 10. No more than Laughter doth a Malefactor, when going to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50213:18"/> Execution. <hi>Saul</hi> was deſirous of being Honoured, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 30. but Honour doth not become a Fool, no more than Snow doth Summer, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 1. Men would be proſperous; but the Proſperity of Fools is their Deſtruction, for then they turn away, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 32. Men would take in the Creature; but when a Fool is fill'd, the Earth is then Diſquieted, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 21, 22. Some would be ſometimes ſpeaking of good things; but Excellent ſpeech doth not become a Fool, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17 7. becauſe it is too High for him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 7.</p>
                  <p>9. There be many that ſay, <hi>Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> Pſal. 4. 6. Yea, all would be glad of Earthly Riches; the very fancying whereof is unto ſome poor Creatures an over-pleaſing Vanity. Now, Riches are entailed upon wiſdom, as <hi>Solomon</hi> did Experience, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. 11. 13. And as Chriſt promiſeth, when Grace, or the Kingdom of God is firſt ſought after, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 33. This hath been alway vertu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But as ſuch have the Promiſes of this Life alſo, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. So we are now haſtning unto the Time of their Accompliſhment; when Meek ones ſhall Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the Earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 11. Flowing together for Wheat, and Wine, and Oyl, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 12. And when their Braſs and Iron ſhall be turned into Gold and Silver, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. 17. And in a way of Reparation for all their former Loſſes, receiving double for their ſhame, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 7. Yea, in this Life an hundred fold for that which they have ſometimes lent to Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 29. Then ſhall their Riches alſo be their Crown, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 24. becauſe they will be taught to Conſecrate their Gain unto the Lord, <hi>Mic.</hi> 4. 13. and to the Duties of his Worſhip, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>10. Wiſdom, or Underſtanding doth make the words of Chriſt to be exceeding plain, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8, 9. and eaſie, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 6. which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe cannot be Apprehended. Saints have the mind of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16. chiefly becauſe they have the Spirit's Guidance, <hi>John</hi> 16. 13. but partly from an innate ſagacity, by which a Man of Underſtanding will draw that out which lyeth deep, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 5 Now, we muſt be Judged by the words of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 12. 48. And therefore woe be to that Soul who doth not underſtand them, and ſo cannot receive them. And if ſome Children would give any thing, to have their Leſſons rendred eaſie; what Fools are thoſe, by whom Facilitating Wiſdom is Deſpiſed? This Grace is worth the ſeeking after, were it onely but to remove that Labour of Duty and ſweating at it, which Poor fallen Man is ſubject unto. Chriſt's Yoak is therefore eaſie to his Diſciple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>11. When wiſdom entreth into thine Heart, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 10. it will Preſerve and keep thee, <hi>v.</hi> 11. To Deliver thee from the way of evil men, <hi>v.</hi> 12.

Vertue may Apprehend, Impriſon, Condemn, and Torture ſin, but nothing ſhort of Grace, will ever prove its proper Executioner, or abſolute Suppreſſor. Grace is Man Rallied, or Re-inforced with a greater ſtrength than ever <hi>Adam</hi> had; which therefore doth ſubdue its Adverſaries, as <hi>David</hi> did thoſe <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 1. whom <hi>Saul</hi> did onely vex, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 47. but was at laſt ſubdued by them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31. 4. Now, is not that Balm worth ſeeking after, which is the onely Healer of a deadly wound, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51. 8? Is not that Armour worth the putting on, which onely will enable to withſtand, and having done all to ſtand, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 13? They who now Mock at ſin, will one day wiſh they had been wiſer, than to Deſpiſe that Grace or Wiſdom, by which they might have been preſerved from its Mortal ſting, although its preſent ſtain were not to be regarded.</p>
                  <p>12. This wiſdom had need be ſpeedily endeavoured after, becauſe there is no wiſdom in the Grave, which Men are going into, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9. 10. The Door of Grace is ſometimes ſhut on Earth, as Fooliſh Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins will Experience, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 10. much more when Hell hath ſhut its mouth upon the Sinners Soul. Oh how Induſtrious would the Damned be, had they but any hope of getting that which formerly they have Deſpiſed. And no Man hath a Leaſe of Life, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. 5. which is enough to ſtartle ſlumbring Fools, for fear of ſleeping unto Death; eſpecially ſince Fools are threatned with the ſhorteſt warning, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 20.

Good Company is a precious Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, but yet the Fooliſh Virgins were not bettered by being in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the wiſe. Fools may be oft Inſtructed, but ſilly Men and Women are ever Learning, and never come unto the knowledge of the Truth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 6, 7.

                  <p>2. Make ſure of Chriſt, who is the Head, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 19. and therefore wiſdom cannot be had without him. Grace is by Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 1. 17.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Metaphorical Oyl (which needs muſt be here meant) moſt commonly denoteth the Special Gifts or Graces of the Spirit, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Light or Knowledge among the reſt; which therefore are oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called Oyntment, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 3.

And becauſe of the full Reſemblance that is between them and Oyl in the Letter; as in theſe following Reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Oyl is very Beautifying; it maketh the Face to ſhine, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 15. Therefore did <hi>Naomi</hi> bid <hi>Ruth</hi> to annoint her ſelf, when going unto <hi>Boaz;</hi> Ruth 3. 3. Such are theſe Gifts and Graces. Grace made Chriſt fairer than the Sons of Men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 2. The chiefeſt of Ten Thouſand, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 10. Yea, therefore his Glory was like the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, becauſe he was ſo full of Grace, <hi>John</hi> 1. 14. Grace makes the Spouſe all Fair and Raviſhing, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 7. 9. Whoſe Comelineſs is not deſtroyed by Holy Terror, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 4. Nor by the Blackneſs of outward Suffering, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 5. This is more Obvious unto a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Eye, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 23. But yet Ingenuous Virgins can alſo witneſs hereunto, both in Relation to the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 9. and Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Oyl is of a Regal Nature, and will be uppermoſt, whatever other Liquors it is mingled with; and therefore to be annointed with freſh Oyl, is put to ſignifie, the Exaltation of one's Horn, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92. 10. Of ſuch a Nature is ſpecial Grace. This Oyl may for a while be under water, when ſhaken by the Tempter's Hand; but ſin ſhall never have Dominion over Saints, becauſe they are under Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. Such may be ſometimes Foiled, but they will be up again, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 16. And every Yoak in time ſhall be deſtroyed from off their Neck, becauſe of the Annointing, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10. 27. which hath been alway Spiritually made good, and will at laſt appear, with reference unto a Temporal Supremacy there intended.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Oyl makes any kind of Motion quick; therefore are Wheels and Locks annointed, together with their Shields of Old, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 21. 5. which made the Enemies Darts to glide off quickly; yea, therefore Men's Bodies alſo were wont to be annointed, to make them nimble. And herein Grace is like to Oyl. Therefore the Saints can run and not be weary, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 31. as were theſe Fooliſh Virgins for lack of Oyl.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50213:22"/> This keepeth Satan's ſhafts from faſtening upon their Shields, and makes them go with leſſer Weights (or fewer Motives) and with leſs creaking noiſe, becauſe their Wheels are Oyled. And though Chriſt's Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be the onely Key, yet muſt that Key be Oyled with Grace, which much availeth in the work of Opening the Door of Mercy, <hi>James</hi> 5. 16. Not that it works with Chriſt in point of Impetration; but as it is required by him, unto the Believer's being benifited by his Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Oyl is Embalming; therefore Chriſt's Body was annointed to the Burying, <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 8. And others came afterwards, on purpoſe to annoint him, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 1. Grace alſo keeps from Putrefaction. The Saints very Bodies ſhall be made Incorruptible, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 53. When Grace is perfected in them, as it was in Chriſt, who therefore might not ſee Corruption, becauſe he was God's Holy One, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 27. Yea, Holy <hi>David</hi> had (in ſome ſence) this Priviledge made good to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 10. However, in a Spiritual ſence, this Oyl of Grace wears off ſins fretting Ruſt, and doth ſecure its Owner's Name from Rotting, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 7. And keeps the Soul from entring into thoſe Degrees of Moral Putrefaction, which others cannot prevent.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Oyl is of an Healing Nature, which therefore is applied to wounds, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 34. and was Symbolically uſed by thoſe who had the Gift of Healing, <hi>James</hi> 5. 14. <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 13. Such an All-heal is Grace. What noiſom Ulcers are upon ſinners Hearts, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 5, 6. which Grace keeps ſweet at preſent, and is in the way of an Effectual Cure. The beſt of Nature's Medicines are onely Skinning, or Repercuſſive, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning Rebellious Humours, which makes them rage the more, and break out other where with greater fierceneſs. But Grace Deſigns the altering of one's Conſtitution, beginning with the Heart or Mind, and thence expelling into the Members, that which it will not leave there neither, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23, 24.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Oyl doth not break the Head. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141. 5. But is of a Mollify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nature, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 6. The Emblem of ſoft words, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55. 21. And that which gently doth inſinuate it ſelf into a Part or Member. Such alſo is the Property of Grace. A bare Command is very Irritating, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 8. And Slaviſh fear begets an Angry kind of Duty, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 25, 26. Which is Tormenting, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 18. But Grace doth ſoften a ſtony Heart, <hi>Ezek</hi> 36. 26. And ſoaks into the Will, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 41. Gently diſperſing peccant Humours, and making the Soul to Act from Love, ſo that Commandments are not grievous, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 3. And when there's moſt of Grace in any man, there's moſt of ſweetneſs, both in Relation to himſelf and others, proceeding from the Nature of this Oyl.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:50213:22"/> 7. Oyl is not apt to Freeze, like other Liquid things. No more is Grace. Nature is very fluid in the Summer Seaſon, and Hypocrites are Active, while they are in the midſt of warm encouragements; but when that Sun declines, how ſtiff are ſuch, how Cold for Chriſt, and like-dead Flies, untill the Spring returneth? Whereas a truly Gracious Soul, though ſenſible of ſuch with-drawings, yet is as fit for preſent uſe as ever, becauſe of that Native warm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 29. But chiefly from the Grace or Fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that Olive-Tree which they are Graffed into, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 17.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Oyl is not apt to waſt, but is the Preſerver of other things; and therefore Colours are laid in Oyl. A Carnal Man's Goodneſs is like the Dew, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6. 4. Or of a wateriſh Nature, which quickly dryeth up: And Moral Vertues are of a pretty Colour, but apt to fade, becauſe not laid in Grace. How quickly did that Lovely Young Man look pale, for lack of following Chriſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 20, 21, 22. Or meerly becauſe his Vertue was not added unto Faith, as it ſhould have been, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. But Grace is of an Everlaſting Nature, not waxing lean with Age, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92. 14. But ſpringing up to Everlaſting Life, <hi>John</hi> 4. 14. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Nature of its Covenant, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 40.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Oyl is of a Chearing Fragrant Nature. We read of the ſmell of Oyntments, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 10. whereby they do bewray themſelves, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 16. Filling the Houſe with Odour, <hi>John</hi> 12. 3. which ſtirs up Love, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 3. and is Heart chearing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 9. Therefore 'tis called the Oyl of Joy, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 3. and Gladneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 7. which was not to be uſed in the Times of Mourning, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 2. Nor with a Sin-Offering, <hi>Lev.</hi> 5. 11. Or Jealouſie-Offering, <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. 15. which call'd for ſadneſs. All which agrees to Grace, in point of Savour and Refreſhing, confeſt by all who have their Senſes Exerciſed. Chriſt had Grace poured into his Lips, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 2. whoſe Lips were therefore like to Lillies, dropping ſweet ſmelling Myrrh, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 13. Yea, and how Odoriferous might Profeſſors be, did they but Open their Box of Oyntment, or were but in the Exerciſe of Goſpel-Graces.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Oyl is a very ſtately, ſatisfying, and Pleaſant Nouriſher. Much of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Food was Oyl, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 12. whoſe pleaſantneſs was that by which their Manna was reſembled, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 8.

A worldly prudent Man can ſtop the current of his Teſtimony when he pleaſeth, becauſe his Prophecying Spirit is of an Ordinary Nature, which therefore is Subject to ſuch kind of Prophets, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 32.

As theſe were Types of Chriſt, who was both Prophet, Prieſt, and King, and was accordingly Annointed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 1. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 27. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 7. Thus alſo Grace reſembleth Oyl, becauſe the Saints are thereby both Deſign'd and fitted for ſuch Offices; for he which hath Annointed them is God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21. Poor Carnal Creatures are Deſign'd for Lower Uſes, whilſt Higher Places are reſerv'd for Saints; who as they are at preſent Kings and Prieſts to God, ſo they ſhall Reign on Earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 10. as <hi>David</hi> did ſoon after his Annointing; and then will Fooliſh Virgins wiſh they had their Veſſels filled with this Oyl.</p>

                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:50213:23"/> 14. Oyl was of Uſe in Sacrifices, which <hi>Jacob</hi> therefore poured twice upon his Pillar, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 18. and 35. 14. Whereby to Teſtifie his Thankfulneſs, and gain ſome further Mercy from the Lord; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of that Typical Meat-Offering did conſiſt, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 4. which was as Sauce unto their Sacrifices, to make them Savoury and Compleat; as Grace doth Goſpel-Sacrifices, which therefore is Required in Prayer, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 8. and Praiſes, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16. But therefore it was Their grievous ſin, who ſet God's Oyl before the Heathen, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23. 41. And ſent their Oyntments unto <hi>Aſhur, Iſa.</hi> 57. 9. meerly to get their Favour. And thus Grace is an Acceptable Sacrifice, when Offered up by Chriſt, the Altar, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. Yea, though there be nothing but this Oyl, or Grace appearing in the will, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 12. But woe be to thoſe <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who proſtitute this Sacred Oyl at the Feet of Men, or give up their Light and Duty unto the wills of others, (as many Profeſſors in our days have done) meerly to curry Favour with them.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Oyl may be ſpoyled very much, as Ointment is apt to be, by ſome dead Flies got into it, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10. 1. And as Oyl (Typically) was of Old, when touch'd by one that was unclean by having touched a dead Body, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 12, 13. And thus, even Saints themſelves (yea, and their very Graces) are apt to be unſavoury, by reaſon of ſome ſtrong Corruption laboured under. Yea, that which ſome Men count a ſorry Flie, may be ſufficient to breed this Putrefaction, untill it be taken away, which cannot be without ſome kind of loſs. And in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, one's touching (or compliance with) Man's Prohibition of Temple-work, or Open worſhip (which is the onely thing intended by that Prophet <hi>Haggai)</hi> is apt to make this Oyl unclean, or to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct Communion with any ſo polluted.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Oyl is of ſpecial Uſe for Light (which is the Reſemblance chiefly here intended:) And ſo is Grace, which alſo doth much reſemble Light, as ſin doth Darkneſs. Darkneſs is meerly privative, and ſo is ſin: But Grace is of a poſitive Nature, which therefore hath its Author, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. as Light had its Creator, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 3. Grace is from Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 1. 16. as Light is from the Sun; and ſin from Satan, <hi>John</hi> 8. 44. that Prince of Darkneſs, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. The Light is ſweet, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11. 7. And Grace is a gladſome ſight <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 23. whilſt none but Night-Birds can delight in Darkneſs. The Light makes manifeſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 13. And ſo doth Grace, the Nature of ſin and Duty, which poor dark ſinners do not underſtand. There's no Communion between the Light and Darkneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14. And as not in a Natural, ſo neither in this Moral ſence. Darkneſs is ſtaining, <hi>Job</hi> 3. 5. and ſo is ſin: But Light and Grace do give a ſhining luſtre, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8. 1. Darkneſs and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50213:24"/> Sin (both of them) are exceeding Cold, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 12. whereas Grace (like the Sun) doth ſet the Heart on burning, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 32. Darkneſs Occaſions Terror, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. 5. and ſo doth ſin, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 16. But Grace and Light are equally rejoycing. Darkneſs and Sin expoſe unto miſtakes and Dangers, both which are happily prevented through the Light of Grace. Darkneſs unfits for Action, as theſe poor Fooliſh Virgins did Experience; whereas the others Lightſome Oyl kept them in a walking poſture (after their being once awakened) untill the Bridegroom came.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the Principal of thoſe reſpects, wherein New Covenant-Grace reſembleth Oyl; the laſt of which <hi>(viz.</hi> Its being of ſpecial uſe for Light) is chiefly here intended. In which regard, I now ſhall a little further clear up the Nature of this Oyl, or Grace, with reference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Light, for which it ſerveth. And ſo,</p>
                  <p>1. This Oyl of Grace (together with its Light) is meerly Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and no way Natural. There is a Natural Oyl, and there is alſo a Light of Nature, in a Moral ſence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14. proceeding from a Myſtical (yet Naturally Moral) Oyl. But now, this Oyl and Light of Grace is wholly of another Nature. The firſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s Paradiſe was Richly ſtored with Natural Olive-Trees, both in the Letter and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery; but Goſpel-Grace cannot be had ſave by a freſh engrafting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that ſuper-natural Olive-Tree, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 24. or Second <hi>Adam,</hi> who is from Heaven, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 47. Nature's Wild Olive will never yield this Oyl, which thoſe are therefore ſtrangers unto, who have not in them any thing, ſave what is Natural.</p>
                  <p>2. This Oyl and Light of Grace is alway Accompanied with ſome good Meaſure of Spiritual Heat. There is a ſhining Light,-which is not burning; as that of the Moon, which fitly anſwers unto Nature: But that of the Sun (which is an undoubted Type of Chriſt, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 2.) doth ſet the Heart on burning, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 32. as well as open the Diſciples Eyes, <hi>v.</hi> 31. The Light of Grace is therefore troubleſome unto the moſt, becauſe it is ſo hot; whereas a Carnal Jew can Joy (at leaſt-wiſe) in <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s Light, Abſtracted from its burning Heat, <hi>John</hi> 5. 35. Chriſt's Oyl doth ſcald the Old Man out of Doors; and his very Light or Brightneſs is Deſtructive unto wickedneſs, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 8. by which 'tis to be known from that more Carnal Light, which hath no burning Influence upon its Owner's Droſs, no more than <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi>'s had upon his Covetouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>3. This Oyl of Grace (as that in the Letter alſo) muſt firſt be fired before it yieldeth any Heat or Light, whatever immediate uſe it may be of, in other regards: Grace doth depend on Chriſt, not onely as
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50213:24"/> its Author, but alſo as he muſt Actuate it; or elſe that Habit muſt ſleep in Cold and Darkneſs. Thoſe two Diſciples had of this Oyl within their Veſſels; but till Chriſt came and kindled it, they neither ſaw, nor were they warmed, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 31, 32. Saints never will be Independents, with reference unto Chriſt's renewing Influences; but he that works the Diſpoſition, muſt alſo draw it forth to Exerciſe; elſe though they be ſomething, yet can they do nothing, <hi>John</hi> 15. 5. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they Move, as well as Live in him, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 28. 'Tis to be feared, thoſe men have bought a Wind of Satan, who think they have the Spirit's Wind at their Command.</p>
                  <p>4. The Light of this Oyl is of no uſe unto a Natural Eye, but is Offenſive to it. Saints have Diſcoveries thereby made, which others do not underſtand; both in Relation unto Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 9, 10. and things of a Spiritual Nature, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. Chriſt was that Light, <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. whom yet the Common Jews received not, <hi>v.</hi> 11. but their very Seers were offended with it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 12. partly becauſe it was too Manifeſting, <hi>John</hi> 3. 20. and partly, becauſe it was too Great, or like unto the Sun it ſelf, when looked on; this Object being Light, as well as that by which 'tis ſeen, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. 9. Yea, therefore was <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s Light rejoyced in but for a Seaſon, <hi>John</hi> 5. 35. though his was far Inferiour unto Chriſt's, <hi>John</hi> 1. 8. That Light which Natural Men can bear without Offence, (in point of Doctrine or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation) is much to be ſuſpected.</p>
                  <p>This Light of Grace is very clear (compared with any other) or that which makes the Object very plain. Poor Heathens do rather feel than ſee, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 27. and common <hi>Iſraelites</hi> could not look very far, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 13. but Goſpel-Saints behold with open Face, (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with others) though in a Glaſs compared with their Future Sight, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. Faith gives the cleareſt Evidence, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. And therefore True Believers are beſt Reſolved, in point of Sin and Duty, which others ſtick at, through want of full Conviction. O how is Grace to be deſired then, ſince Anſwerable to the Meaſure of our Light! So is the ſafeneſs of our Walking, <hi>John</hi> 11. 9, 10. and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction that our way is Right, <hi>John</hi> 12. 35.</p>
                  <p>6. This Light is of a Growing Nature, which ſhineth more and more unto the Perfect Day, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 18. A Natural Eye (both in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Myſtery) is apt to wax dim with Age; but though ſuch as Chriſt doth englighten, may at the firſt ſee Men as Trees, yet do they afterwards ſee clearly, <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 23, 24, 25. The way of the wicked is as Darkneſs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 19. but Saints walk in a Beam unto the Sun, Journeying as <hi>Abraham</hi> did unto the Southward, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 1. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50213:25"/> their Light muſt needs increaſe. And when the Moon (or Light of Nature) ſhall equalize the preſent Sun, then ſhall the Sun (or Light of Grace) be as ſeven Suns United into one, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 26. untill Saints know as they are known, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12.</p>
                  <p>7. The Meaſure of this Light (as that of a Lamp in the Letter alſo) is Anſwerable to the Weik, or that wherein it is ſubjected. Some Men have larger Hearts, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 29. or more Receptive Weiks, therefore their Light is greater, <hi>v.</hi> 30. All Saints have Grace, but ſome have more, according to the Meaſure of the Gift of Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 7. and as Occaſion doth require. The Wind of Temptations blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in ſome places more; therefore the Light had need be ſtronger. Some have more Curious work in hand, whoſe Light had therefore need be clearer. Some Men have work in ſeveral places, as had <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28. who therefore needed Extraordinary Knowledge, <hi>v.</hi> 26. Or many Lights ſet up at once, as <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 8. I may not offer to un-Saint another, ſimply becauſe his Light is leſs, in caſe it be ſufficient for the Preſent work, as this, of going forth.</p>
                  <p>8. This Lightſom Oyl is ſeparable from its Lamp and Veſſel; as theſe poor Fooliſh Virgins Evidenced, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 3. and did Experience, <hi>v.</hi> 8. 'Tis but a common Adjunct, and no Proper Accident, ſave as it is ſo made by Grace. When thoſe bad Angels fell from Grace, yet did they keep their Eſſence ſtill: Nor is it from a Natural Neceſſity that Goſpel-Saints ſhall never fall from Grace, but meerly from an Adventitious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking on their be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>alf, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 40. When ſuch are Tempted to Preſume or Vapour, let them remember the Root bears Them, not They the Root, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 18. And therefore let Mens Lamps and Veſſels be throughly ſearched in due time.</p>
                  <p>9. This Light is in-extinguiſhable and Everlaſting. The Prince of the Air can never blow it out, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 31, 32. The Waters of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution ſhall never wholly quench it, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 7. Nor will it ever of it ſelf go out, as did theſe Fooliſh Virgins Lamps, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 8. which Argueth their having never (Spiritually) been enlightned, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 6. This Oyl is like that Widdow's, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 16. And this Light is like <hi>David</hi>'s, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. 36. whereas the Lamp of the wicked ſhall be put out, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 9. It is with Grace, as with the Sun, whoſe Light is ſubject to be Clouded, Eclipſed, and oft-times hidden for a Night; yet it is alway ſhining, although not alway ſeen.</p>
                  <p>10. This Light muſt yet be carefully looked after, for fear of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in Arrears through want of conſtant watchfulneſs; as theſe wiſe (ſlumbring) Virgins did Experience. Thoſe Sacred Lamps were daily to be Dreſſed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 7. and ſo muſt theſe be Trimmed, elſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50213:25"/> un-removed ſnuffs will prejudice their ſhining luſtre. And though New Covenant-Grace ſhall never wholly fail, yet is there room for the uſe of means, which are as neceſſary, as the End is certain. And that's the Happineſs of all wiſe Virgins, that Chriſt hath undertaken to rouze them up, as well as to ſecure their Oyl.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. What's meant by Lamps, diſtinct from Veſſels? And what is further meant by Oyl in the Veſſels, together with the Lamps? And by the Fooliſh Virgins taking no Oyl with them?</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I. By Lamps (diſtinct from Veſſels here) do ſeem to be chiefly meant, the Souls Affections, in competition with its Judgment, as all theſe Metaphors do joyntly evidence. Oyl is undoubtedly here put for Light: And Veſſels are the ſubject of that Oyl, from whence the Lamps are fed, or kept from going out. Now, a Mans Judgment is the ſeat of Light, which therefore fitly Anſwers unto the Veſſels, from whence the working of Affections is maintained; and therefore theſe Lamps do fully Anſwer unto thoſe Affections. And this Interpretation (unto me) doth ſeem to be more fully worded, than that of Practice and Profeſſion, which though it be more commonly received, yet is it not unto the preſent purpoſe; ſince Practice can no way Anſwer unto Veſſels, or Seat of Light, although Profeſſion is ſome what like to Lamps: And ſince falſe hearts may Practiſe much, as well as make a great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; and ſo the difference between a Wiſe and Fooliſh Virgin (chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended here) would be deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>II. Oyl taken in the Veſſel, doth Naturally import theſe two things further.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it was not now to Buy, but ready at Hand, yea, in Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion alſo; and in the ſureſt part of Man, <hi>viz.</hi> The Heart or Judgment. Each Goſpel-Saint is Actually bleſſed with all Spiritual Bleſſings, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3. And though his Grace be hid, yet it is hidden in the Heart, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 4. which is a Caſtle that Satan cannot Storm, nor ſhall it be ever taken from him, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 42. as was that ſingle Talent, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 28. which was hid elſe-where, <hi>v.</hi> 25. Things in the Heart are ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>er than in the Head or Hand; and of more preſent uſe upon Occaſion, than if in the neareſt ſhop that is. Therefore wiſe Virgins will have Oyl in their Veſſels, on purpoſe to prevent that double Danger.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Oyl in the Veſſel intimateth ſtore thereof; or ſuch a Competent meaſure of it, as will maintain the Lamp ſo long as its Light is needful. Indeed the leaſt drop of Grace's Oyl is of the ſame laſting Nature with abundance; but yet a Competency of its Meaſure is alſo requiſite unto its laſtingneſs, by virtue of a Divine Appointment, which hath ſo Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered its Preſervation. Therefore we read of a ſufficient Grace, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:50213:26"/> 12. 9. and putting on the whole Armour of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 13. and of abounding, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8 in one Grace added to another, <hi>v.</hi> 5. that ſo we might not fall, <hi>v.</hi> 10. nor can there be true Grace without it, <hi>v.</hi> 9.</p>
                  <p>III. Theſe Fooliſh Virgins may here be ſaid to take no Oyl.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe they had not the Oyl of Grace, but onely that of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as is moſt evident, becauſe their Oyl did wholly fail, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 8. which that of Grace will never do, but ſpringeth up to Everlaſting Life, <hi>John</hi> 4. 14. Now, that which is not of the Nobleſt kind, is oft times repreſented as if it had no Being. Thus Rational Creatures are called the World, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. and True Believers all Things, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 20. and Idols (or falſe gods) Nothing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 4. And thus may Nature's Oyl (or Light) be termed, None at all. This quells their Pride who Glory in a thing of Nought; and ſhews their ſin, who Nullifie t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ue Grace, by making it the ſame (for Kind) with Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe this very Common Oyl was onely in their Lamps, not in their Veſſels. They had ſome good Affections, but were not Acted by a ſolid Principle in their firſt going forth, for then their Light would have continued: Since the Command (had that been eyed) was every whit as clear, (or rather more) the ſecond time. Now, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicious Acts are counted none; and therefore, although the Jews did oft-times Pray with much ſelf-humbling, yet it is ſaid, they Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 13. nor were they Humbled to that day, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44. 10. becauſe they onely did ſuch things from flaſhy Affections, and not from Judgment. How ſadly Fools will ſometimes weep, which yet among the Wiſe is counted Nothing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe this Oyl was ſpent (at leaſt, they would not uſe it) when there was moſt Occaſion for its Light; or when the Cry was made at Mid-night. Now, uſeleſs things are ſaid to have No Being; as <hi>Job</hi>'s un-uſeful Friends are called Nothing, <hi>Job</hi> 6. 21. nor ever had ſuch things ſome kind of Being; in which regard, that onely ſeemeth to be had, which proves unprofitable (in the Iſſue) unto its Owner, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 18. Well therefore may Profeſſors go for workers of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 23. when they back-ſlide, becauſe their Zeal is gone, when Chriſt and they ſtand moſt in need thereof; which therefore is (in ſuch a caſe) as if it had not been at all. Chriſt Repreſents theſe Fooliſh Virgins, as thoſe who took no Oyl at firſt.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="question">
                  <head>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. Why were Lamps taken by theſe Virgins, who took no Oyl?</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Becauſe they needs muſt have a Form of Godlineſs, elſe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50213:26"/> all Wiſe Virgins would caſt them off, and not be for Communion with them; therefore ſo ſmall a matter ſhall not part them. <hi>Saul</hi> was deſirous of <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Continuance with him, which made him do more than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he would have done, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 30. Formal Profeſſors would gladly ſhine with others Beams, eſpecially if empty Lamps (put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a common ſtock) will make them Partners. Yea, Conſcience it ſelf will not be quiet without the ſtirring of ſome Affections; but if thoſe Lamps be to be ſeen, poor Fools are ſatisfied. Thoſe are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be called Virgins, whoſe Outſide is not very Neat and Trim.</p>
                  <p>2. Becauſe theſe Lamps are Light (Compared with Veſſels full of Oyl) which therefore lazy Hypocrites will rather chuſe to bear. Oyl in a Gracious Heart, is like to Water in its Element, which is not Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous; but unto others, 'tis Grievous to be born, who therefore have no delight to carry it. The Light of this Sacred Oyl is like that of the Sun, Diſcovering Moats as well as Dirt; both which an Hypocrite can bear the Preſence, but not the Sight of, in ſuch a Reproving way, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hateth it, <hi>John</hi> 3. 20. This Oyl is alſo thought too Dear, becauſe the Heart or Veſſel muſt be emptied of other things; which none but Fools will either wonder at, or grudge: But yet ſuch therefore are conte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>3. Such poſſibly may think, they have this Oyl of Grace, or that it is not now to take; and upon that Account it may be left behind, through ſelf-undoing ſelf-conceit. There have been ſelf-deceivers in all Ages, who yet do moſt abound in theſe laſt days of ours, or in the Declining State of Churches and Profeſſors, Typified by thoſe ſelf-conceited <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odiceans,</hi> who were the laſt of thoſe Typical <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches. Which ſad miſtake ariſeth, partly from lothneſs to enquire, leſt Conſcience ſhould be diſquieted, or leſt the Soul ſhould ſuffer loſs; as when Braſs Money is become one's own, its Owner will not therefore let another rub it. Partly, becauſe they might think Oyl inſeparable from a Lamp, (or that Affections are always Spiritually Judicious) and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Lamps, did thence conclude their having Oyl, Partly, from Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Pride, becauſe Hypocrites would not be thought to want ſo main a buſineſs: And partly, from the Reſemblance that is between Special and Common Oyl, or Grace and Nature; as is between Tin and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which therefore (at leaſt, by Fools) are oft Confounded.</p>
                  <p>4. Theſe Fooliſh Virgins thought they had enough to ſerve their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent turn; and Hypocrites are for no more, in matters of a Spiritual Nature. As is the work, ſuch is the need of ſuitable Inſtruments; a wooden Needle may ſerve to ſtitch ſome coarſer Cloth together: And their firſt going forth was Manifeſtly of a Lower Nature. I will not
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50213:27"/> ſay, that Goſpel-Grace is abſolutely neceſſary unto the Second going forth; for then, all of that ſort muſt be concluded to be Real Saints, from that very Act of going out; (which I dare not affirm, unleſs the whole of that Duty be performed, which I ſhall clear up afterwards:) but ſomething far ſhort of Grace, might carry theſe out at firſt; as is apparent, both from the Iſſue, and from the Nature of that fore-named work, which might Occaſion this neglect.</p>
                  <p>5. Such might, at leaſt-wiſe think this Special Oyl was to be had in Time, although they had it not at preſent: And Hypocrites are not for being over-haſty in looking out for Chriſt's Commodities. They might preſume to borrow Oyl of their Companions, in caſe of need, or that they ſhould have time enough to buy it, as may be gathered from their attempting afterwards, in both theſe ways to be ſupplied. Such are acquainted with Chriſt's tender Bowels, and readineſs to help poor ſinners, which is abuſed by them to indulge their preſent careleſsneſs, and to delay their cloſing with a preſent Offer, though to the hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Eternal State, by dallying with ſuch Opportunities.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. At their firſt going out they were in the Prim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> their Affections, and Zeal for Duties of ſuch a Nature. There was ſome kind of another Heart (like that of <hi>Saul</hi>'s, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 9.) beſtowed upon all Profeſſors at that time, which raiſed them unto an higher pitch than Ordinary. They were then like to Ground which had been long un-occupied; and therefore that firſt Crop was Extraordinary. That was the firſt reſiſtance made, which uſually is very violent, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially among the Ruder ſort, although not laſting. An Ordinary Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit will Act to Admiration, when raiſed up; and upon that account, theſe Fooliſh Virgins might thus out-act themſelves at firſt, untill their Youthful heat was cooled.</p>
                  <p>2. Their way was not ſo dark (at their firſt going out) but that it might be hit, with empty Lamps, at leaſt, without this ſpecial Light. It might be ſome kind of Evening then, but not a Mid-night Darkneſs, as when the Cry is made, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 6. It was an eaſie matter Then, to bear an open Teſtimony, becauſe they had ſome colour of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (at that time) to bear them out. And though they ran the hazard of their Eſtates, yet had they then good ſtore of Company, which will provoke a Worldly minded Man to ſpend more freely, than elſe he would do. Nor was there any need of Special Light, to ſhew the groſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that Church-ſtate, which then was gone out of.</p>
                  <p>3. At their firſt going out, their All was laid at Stake; and in that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50213:27"/> Caſe Men will run out at Mid-night without a Lamp or Candle. Their utter Extirpation then was ſtrongly feared, which was enough to draw Men out, who onely had the Light of Nature: But when the Cry is made, the greateſt apprehended Danger is in going forth, which may Occaſion their pretending Then a want of Light. Men are not ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to leave their Beds at Mid-night, when Liberty may be ſecured by keeping in; or whilſt there is any hope of being Indulged by ſome leſs Complyance.</p>
                  <p>4. There was a greater probability of preſent Recompence at their firſt going out, than at the ſecond time; which is a great Inducement unto Graceleſs Perſons. Poor Carnal Profeſſors may help to pluck down Antichriſtian Officers, if likely to enjoy their Lands and Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: And Mercenary Souldiers will Fight moſt Deſperately, in hope of more than Ordinary Pay: Yea, very Hypocrites (or ſuch as <hi>Judas</hi> was) may bear an open Teſtimony on Chriſt's behalf, ſo long as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence doth ſeem to ſavour it, though onely with the Applauſe of People. But when the Cry is made, theſe Livings, Spoils, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Approbations may be more likely to be loſt by going forth, which makes the Second time more Difficult.</p>
                  <p>5. The Truth is, at their firſt going out, theſe Fooliſh Virgins went they knew not whither, and meerly becauſe their Veſſels were not ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Oyl; which made them to attempt at firſt, what afterwards they were not free to proſecute, as might be inſtanced in abundantly. Did not ſome Act and Speak, as <hi>Balaam</hi> Bleſſed <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not being them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at ſuch a time, and as their contrary after-Practice hath evinced? Would many ſo much have cried ſome things up, and others down, had they fore-ſeen what followed afterwards? This was the Fruit of their not being Acted by a Principle, or want of Oyl in Veſſels.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Becauſe the Taking of this Oyl is Principally pretended unto, by all ſorts of Spiritual Virgins. Would not all Profeſſors be counted Gracious? Would they not be thought to be endued with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Light? Yea, will they not grant themſelves to be notorious Fools, in caſe this Holy Oyl were wholly wanting? All will count him a very Fool, who having none but empty Veſſels, doth ſtyle himſelf an Oyl-Merchant, which is the Virgins caſe: Yea, will not he call himſelf a Fool, who having but one thing needful to remember, doth yet forget to take it? This Oyl is Wiſdom, under another Name; he therefore needs muſt be a Fool, who leaves this Oyl behind him; as he is call'd, whoſe Wiſdom fails him by the way, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10. 3.</p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:50213:28"/>
                  <p> 2. Becauſe their is no Light or Guidance, without this Oyl. 'Tis not in Man (as he is Naturally conſidered) to Direct his ſteps, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 23. at leaſt-wiſe not in Spiritual caſes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. or with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto the Bridegroom's way. And though the Scriptures are a ſhining Light, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. yet are they onely as a Lamp, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 105. which muſt be fed with Grace's Oyl, elſe it will be of little uſe, in point of ſafe Direction, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. Now, is it not a very Fooliſh part, to walk in unknown Paths without a Light? How may ſuch Wander, for ought they know, yea, meet with harm, at leaſt-wiſe go in continual fear, and meerly through their careleſs Folly.</p>
                  <p>3. Becauſe there elſe will be no Perſevering to the end, which is a point of high Concernment. Nature may Foot it for a while, without this lightſome Oyl, but ſoon grows weary, as did theſe Fooliſh Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, and upon that Account. Now, to begin, and not to Perſervere, doth Argue Folly, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 3. and that upon a double ſcore. Partly, becauſe all former Labour is thereby loſt; and is not he juſtly mocked, who doth deſiſt from what he hath begun to Build, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 29, 30? But eſpecially, becauſe he onely ſhall be ſaved, who doth endure unto the End, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 13. and there can be no higher Folly, than not to think of Soul-Concernments.</p>
                  <p>4. Becauſe the Trimmeſt Lamps will not Advantage, but onely Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace the Bearer of an empty Veſſel. Poor Fooliſh Virgins muſt have their Lamps; as in my Text; yea, they will Trim them alſo, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 7. but to no purpoſe, in caſe there be no Oyl. Lamps are no Lightſome Bodies of themſelves, and in the Dark their Trimming is not ſeen, which therefore needs muſt be unprofitable Burdens; yea, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ridiculous alſo: As when a Man is ſeen to carry ſome curious Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn (in the Night) without a Candle. What are the moſt Raiſed Affections, if manifeſtly void of Truth and Judgment, but a piece of Neat, well-worded Non-ſence? Which <hi>Solomon</hi> calls the Sacrifice of Fools, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5. 1. It were far better to make no ſhew at all, than thus to ſhame one's ſelf, by offering to deceive another's raiſed Expectation; and therefore Hypocrites are moſt egregious Fools.</p>
                  <p>5. Becauſe Another's Oyl or Light will no way benefit a Fooliſh Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, at ſuch a time. Indeed one Lamp, or Candle (in the Letter) may ſhew the way to ſeveral Walkers, but not in a Myſtical ſence. And though ſome formerly have ſeen with others Eyes, yet is it not ſo likely now, or in an hour of Temptation. Wiſe Virgins are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to lend what Light they can afford, upon a ſerious Motion made, but Fools cannot receive it, at leaſt-wiſe will not; and then the cleareſt Sun-beam will not Advantage him whoſe Eye is either out, or
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50213:28"/> ſhut. And though a Blind man may be (and oft-times is) Directed by anothers Guidance, yet Fooliſh Virgins (in ſuch a caſe and time as this) will not believe the Wiſe, the Danger of going out is now ſo Viſible.</p>
                  <p>6. Becauſe this Oyl or Light might eaſily have been procured by them, if ſought for in due time. Silver and Gold are deeply hidden under Ground, which yet Men are content to dig for, whilſt Heaven is diſ-regarded, although it may be ſeen with looking upwards. The choiceſt good things are proffered upon the cheapeſt terms, <hi>viz.</hi> for Asking, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 7. and without Price, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1. Yet moſt Men ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuſe to Labour (and ſpend their Mony alſo) for that which doth not ſatisfie, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 2. Nor is this Oyl a Burden, ſave unto thoſe who have it not. Now, this is the higheſt Aggravation of Man's Folly, to Periſh for want of that which would have coſt him nothing.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Upon the whole, we may Obſerve from hence, that Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites (or Fooliſh Virgins) will have their Lamps with them, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe is left behind. Thoſe may be ſuſpected to be no Virgins, or Viſible Saints, who have not had ſome good Affections ſtirring in them, and with Reſpect unto Time Truths, and Duties, ſuch as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Bridegroom is, and going forth to meet him. But yet Hell's mouth is full of good Deſires; and flaſhy Affections are nothing like unto a Spouſe's Love; yea, thoſe full Sails (without the Ballaſt of a Solid Judgment) may onely haſten the over-turning of an empty Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. What ſhall we then think of Perſons diſ-affected to the things of Chriſt? Who needs muſt be Prophane, if naked good Affections may be in thoſe, who are but Formaliſts, or Fooliſh Virgins.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Poor Fooliſh Virgins are to be known, as by their want of Oyl, ſo by their want of Care to take it with them, at leaſt-wiſe in their Veſſels, together with their Lamps. The diſ-regarding of a Principle doth Argue Mens Natural Fooliſhneſs; much more in Spiritual caſes, becauſe theſe are of greateſt Conſequence: And then, how many Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Virgins are there to be ſeen, in this Profeſſing Generation. The Generality of Profeſſors follow Chriſt, as thoſe did <hi>Abſalom,</hi> in their ſimplicity, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 11. Nor are they careful to Inform the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo as to hold unto a Righteous Principle. Thence are ſuch ſad Apoſtacies, and ſhameful ſelf-contradicting Practices, which make their Folly manifeſt beyond diſpute.</p>

So that the Difference between a Wiſe and Fooliſh Virgin is very great, in caſe their Veſſels be but looked into, by means whereof moſt Hypocrites might be Diſcovered. Away with that Soul-ruining Opinion, That Grace and Nature do onely Differ in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; ſince Chriſt ſaith plainly, the Fooliſh Virgins had no Oyl, that is, no Grace at all; as had the Wiſe, and in their Veſſels alſo: or as was Evidenced by their Principled good Affections, and Acting from a Spiritually enlightned Judgment.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Search your Veſſels well. Profeſſors periſh for want of ſelf-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination. I like not ſome mens Boaſting; ſince empty Veſſels are wont to y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Truſt not unto another's good Opinion; it was the Ruine of theſe Fooliſh Virgins, becauſe they had Communion with the Wiſe. Be not deceived with the Matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Duties; Chriſt calls them workers of Iniquity, who could ſay much in that Reſpect, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22, 23. Preſume not upon your having Done and Suffered, with reference unto Time Truths, and Duties Heretofore; the Fooliſh Virgins did go out at firſt to meet the Bridegroom, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 1, 2. Nor may we gather Satisfaction from being awakened with the Cry, or from a Trimmed Lamp, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willingneſs to borrow Light, with reference unto the Laſt, or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond going out; for ſo far went theſe Fooliſh Virgins.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Study the Nature of this Oyl, in Order to your being made in love therewith. How Nimble will it make you for that Race, which giveth an Incorruptible Crown unto the ſwifteſt Runner, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 24, 25! How will it Heal thoſe Wounds which ſin hath made, in point of Being, though not in point of Guilt! How will its ſavour chear your Spirits; and not yours onely, but others alſo, both God's and Man's! How will it make your Faces ſhine, ſo as that Graceleſs Perſons ſhall witneſs unto your Beauty! How will it feed your Lamps, and Lead you in the Darkeſt way of moſt Myſterious Truths and Duties! And is not this Oyl worth carrying with you? Or will you not Exchange your Puddle-water for it?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Take heed of being cheated with Nature's Oyl, wherewith (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) theſe Fooliſh Virgins Lamps were for a while maintained. This
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50213:29"/> Oyl of Grace was Typified by that Holy Oyl of Old, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 25. peculiarly belonging unto the Prieſts, <hi>v.</hi> 30. who were the Types of Goſpel-Saints, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9.

Yet as this Holy Oyl was Subject to be ſinfully applyed to others beſides the Prieſts, (as Hypocrites may flatteringly be called Saints:) So was it apt to have its like or Counterfeit; both which are evident from that ſtrict Prohibition, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 33. And from the Latter of which <hi>(viz.</hi> its being Imitable) doth ſeem to be hinted to us, that it requireth abundant Knowledge and all Judgment, in way of Tryal to Approve, thoſe things which Differ in point of Excellency, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 9, 10.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Labour to be Engrafted therefore into Chriſt, that good Olive-Tree, as he is called, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 24. from whom this Special Oyl muſt be Derived. Chriſt's Faithful Witneſſes are ſometimes called Olive-Trees, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 4. becauſe the Candleſticks (or Saints and Churches) are maintained with their Oyl or Light, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 12. But yet theſe very Trees (Compared with Chriſt) are onely Olive-Branches, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 12. becauſe Chriſt is the Root of all their Fatneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 17. there is indeed another Root, or a Wild Olive-Tree, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 24. which is the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s Nature: But Souls muſt be cut off from that, and Graffed (contrary unto Nature) into the other, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt, as is there ſignified, before they can partake of his good Oyl, <hi>v.</hi> 17.

                  <p n="5">5. Be ſure to have enough. Improve your Fears of having no Oyl at all, unto the Multiplying of your hidden ſtore. Chriſt calls for widen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mouths, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81. 10. Who giveth Liberally without upbraiding, <hi>James</hi> 1. 5. ſave where his Offers are not Accepted, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 20. In times of Danger, (ſuch as theſe are) no man repenteth of buying neceſſary Arms, although he may not have Occaſion for them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Godlineſs is Profitable unto all things, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will be our mony at any time, eſpecially at Chriſt's Appearing, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10, 11. Yea, this Expenſive hour of Temptation doth need a more than Ordinary ſtock; and theſe wiſe Virgins therefore ſlumbred, becauſe they had not Oyl, or Light enough to keep them waking. Empty your Veſſels therefore, and get them Multiplyed, or Enlarged,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50213:30"/> ſo will this Oyl increaſe, eſpecially when it is poured out (or in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Exerciſe,) and with the Door ſhut upon you, or without Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Look after theſe things betimes. Chriſt calls for being heard <hi>To Day,</hi> Heb. 3. 7. and would not have you to delay your Neighbour (much leſs your ſelves) untill to Morrow, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 28. In Times of bad Trading (ſuch as theſe are) who knows how ſoon Chriſt may ſhut up his ſhop; eſpecially ſince we are now looking for that Lord's-day, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 10. (in a fore-running ſence, explained formerly,) on which he will not work, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 10, 11. However, what Fools are they, who think their Spiritual and Eternal ſtate can be too ſpeedily ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured? Eſpecially ſince Chriſt doth here fore-tell their doleful Portion who took no Oyl with them at firſt. The Time is haſting, when it will be ſufficient to keep Men out for ever, meerly becauſe they come too late, or when the Door is ſhut, which will not be Opened, unto the loudeſt Knock, or Cry, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 25, 26, 27.</p>

Let the Profeſſor's Acting from a Principle of Solid Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in every of his Spiritual Undertakings, evince the having of this Oyl in Veſſels, together with the Lamps of good Affections. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſetting home of which Exhortation, let theſe few Motives be duly weighed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our God is a God of Judgment, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 18. whoſe Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion followeth his fore-knowledge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. Who weigheth the Juſt man's Path, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 7. Who worketh all things after Counſel, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 11. and all whoſe ways are Judgment, 4. 37. His Spirit alſo is a Spirit of Judgment, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4. 4. which therefore is ſhadowed out by thoſe ſeven Eyes engraven upon Chriſt, that Corner-ſtone, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 9. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt hath the ſeven Spirits of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 1. by which is meant the Holy-Ghoſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 4.

Now, what a ſhame it is to Chriſtians, in caſe their Acts be in-judicious; ſince they pretend to be the Children of that God of Judgment, endued with his Spirit of Judgment; and to have put that New Man on, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in Knowledge, after his Image, <hi>(viz.</hi> Chriſt's) who hath Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated them, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Elſe Actions are not Rational, and ſo beneath a Man, much more a Chriſtian; which is a great Reproach, both to a Chriſtian's Perſon and Profeſſion. Inſenſible Creatures are Acted by their Natural qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; Brutes by Inſtinct, and Fools (or Men Diſtracted) by ſudden
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50213:30"/> Fancies: But Sober Perſons walk by a Rule of Judgment. Now, what a ſhame it is for Chriſtians to come ſhort of Men, who ſhould be more, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3. at leaſt-wiſe Rational, ſince onely thoſe are called unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, who have not Faith, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 2. Though Natural Reaſon will never grow up to Goſpel-Faith, yet Grace is ſo far from Deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reaſon, as that it ſelf is nothing elſe but Holy Underſtanding, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9. 10. or Good Judgment, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 66. And therefore ſome Men count Religion a meer Humour, becauſe Profeſſors are not ſeen to be duly Rationa; as when ſuch manifeſtly contradict their own Profeſſed Righteous Principles.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We call for the Exerciſe of utmoſt Judgment in another, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if we our ſelves are any way concerned in their Actings; which ſhould Oblige our walking by that Rule our ſelves. How apt are we to cenſure Another's In-advertency, and to Mock that Fooliſh Builder, who did not firſt ſet down, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 28, 29, 30. <hi>Thou therefore which Teacheſt another, Teacheſt thou not thy ſelf,</hi> Rom. 2. 21? How ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do we Rebuke a Friend or Servant, who doth endammage himſelf or us, through want of being well Adviſed? And ſhall we indulge that Giddineſs in our ſelves, which is injurious to our Souls, or Chriſt? We beg, that God would not Correct us in his Anger, but with Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for fear of being brought to nothing, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 24. And ſhall we Offer unto him a Sacrifice without an Head, or not do unto him, as we would have him do to us, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 31? Yea, therefore Chriſtians ſhould be aſhamed of not Conſidering what they do for him, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5. 1. becauſe the Riches of his Grace hath ſo abounded towards them, in all Wiſdom and Prudence, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 7, 8. as might be cleared up at large.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We uſe to be Preponderate in other Matters, and Chriſtianity is the Higheſt Calling, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 14. which therefore doth require the conſtant Exerciſe of our Matureſt Judgment. Shall we conſider what is ſpoken by us before Judicious Men, and yet be haſty to utter any thing in Prayer to God, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5. 2? Shall we firſt count the Coſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we begin an Earthly Building, and not much more, with reference to our Engaging in the ways of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 27, 28.? Are we content to Learn the Myſtery of a Common Trade, before we Set it up; and ſhall we ruſh into a Goſpel-Temple, before we know the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of that Houſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43. 10? A Man will tell Gold, after his Father; and ſhall we not tell Truth after a Brother, but pin our Faith upon a Teachers ſleeve? And if we are wont to hear both Parties ſpeak, before we Judge in Humane Cauſes; ſhall Chriſt (in any of his Truths, or Members) be Condemned, before he hath been heard
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50213:31"/> toſpeak, <hi>John</hi> 7. 51? How may poor Carnal Creatures thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that ſuch irrational Profeſſors are meerly Humorous?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It may provoke us hereunto, becauſe this Oyl in Veſſels (or walking by a Principle of Solid Judgment) is ſo exceeding Rare, which ſome Men think is not a Duty, and fewer Evidence it by their Practice, among Profeſſors. Good <hi>Agur</hi> humbly thought himſelf In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour unto an Ordinary Man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 2. and yet his Reaſonableneſs (in point of worldly Riches, <hi>v.</hi> 8.) did prove him to be above the moſt: But God doth bid Idolaters to ſhew themſelves Men, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46. 8. And <hi>Solomon</hi> in his Time could not find two among a Thouſand, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7. 28. Yea, it ſhould ſeem, that One could not be found in Populous <hi>Jeruſalem, Jer:</hi> 5. 1. Our Lot is caſt into thoſe Times, wherein a Man is precious, above the Gold of <hi>Ophir, Iſa.</hi> 13. 12. at leaſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there are Seven Women unto One Man, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4. 1. And as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by Mens injudicious Actings. Thence is it, that many are ſo toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to and fro, and Principles ſo frequently contradicted; nor can men give a Reaſon of their Faith or Practice, becauſe they are guided moſtly by Affections, as Ships are by their Stern, and not their Head.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We elſe ſhall want the benefit of that Satisfaction in a Duty, which otherwiſe might be enjoyed. How chearfully both Horſe and Man will Travel in a way that's known, compared with another, though poſſibly an unknown path may be as right and better. And though poor Brutes are pleaſed, if onely Senſe be in its Exerciſe; yet Men (and much more Chriſtians) are like to Fiſhes upon the Land, out of their proper Element, ſave as their Judgment alſo is employed. The Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners miſ-guided Underſtanding doth yield him more imagined content, than doth the Upright Walker's Ignorance. What Pleaſure can any take in Hearing the moſt precious Truths, ſave as he graſps them? Nor is the Conſcience ſatisfied with the faireſt Shews, ſave as Affections are enlivened with an Intelligent Heart or Soul. 'Tis not a Real (but Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional) Act of Faith, which giveth Comfort; or as a Direct Act of Believing is Reflected on: Nor can we Joy in any kind of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Obedience, in a ſolid way, ſave as it is perform'd with Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſince, elſe its Graciouſneſs cannot be known, which groundeth Joy.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Acts unadviſedly performed (or without Judgment) are never Laſting. As is the Root or Fountain, ſo is the durableneſs of ſtreams and Branches. Some little Rivulets (fed by a Living Spring) will hold their Courſe, when greater Land-Floods are wholly dryed up: And Ivy (about the Oak) will dye, when Natural Oak-Branches Live; becauſe that Ivy hath not theſe Branches Root. He onely believeth for
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50213:31"/> a while, who hath no Root, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 13. for want of Hearing with Underſtanding, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 23. Thence is it, that an Hypocrite will not Pray alway, <hi>Job</hi> 27. 10. Nor will a Fool pay that which he hath raſhly Vowed, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5. 4. No more than Fooliſh Virgins will ever perſevere, who take not Oyl in Veſſels at their firſt ſetting out. But that which is done in Judgment, is done for ever, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 19. Its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath been duly weighed, and therefore it will not lightly be Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pented of; Effects and Conſequents have been conſidered, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will not hinder its Purſuance; and that which is begun w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n we look for no Acceptance, much leſs a Rececompence; ſave as our Actings and Affections proceed from Judgment. The Head (among all other Parts) was firſt required, in Legal Sacrifices, <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. 8. becauſe that is the Seat of Knowledge: But if we Offer the blind for Sacrifice, will God be pleaſed with us, or Accept us, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 8? He therefore hears not Sinners, <hi>John</hi> 9. 31. for he hath no pleaſure in ſuch Fools, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5. 4. whoſe Heart is ſo far diſtant from himſelf, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 13. and from their Duty, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 31. And what Reward can Men expect from God, in caſe their Work be of a Brutiſh Nature? Man's Underſtanding is that Male, which God hath Bleſt him with, chiefly for Sacrifices to himſelf; and without which no Bleſſing (but a Curſe) is to be looked for from this great King, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 14. Such may go wrong, as well as right, for ought they know, who know not what they do: And Duty performed by Accident, may Peradventure be Rewarded, or if it ſo falls out. Such act not with Reſpect to a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Command; for then Obedience would be Univerſal; <hi>John</hi> 6. 38, 39. And if the Command ſets not on work, the Promiſe is at Liberty in point of Pay. Such do but half their work at beſt, leaving the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter half undone: And no Inheritance can be expected, unleſs the Lord be followed wholly, <hi>Joſh:</hi> 14. 9.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Diſcretion will Preſerve thee, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 11. but there is he that is Deſtroyed for want of Judgment, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 23. both in reſpect of Sin and Suffering. How ſadly (in his haſte) did <hi>David</hi> ſpeak, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 11. And there is more hope of of a Fool (in point of being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed from Sin) than of one haſty in his words or matters, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29. 20. And as to Sufferings, Judgments are prepared for him that ſcorneth Judgment, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 28, 29. Yea, it went ill with <hi>Moſes,</hi> for ſpeaking unadviſedly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 33. And <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> dyed, for Offering ſtrange Fire before the Lord, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10. 1, 2. being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Diſtempered in their Heads, as ſeemeth to be hinted by that

And if the bare Carnality of Affections (Typified by that ſtrange Fire) be of ſo ſad a Nature, how do they take God's Name in vain, (for which he will not hold them guiltleſs, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 7.) who Sleep, or Wander in a Religious Duty? And what if he then ſhould cut them off, as he did thoſe Prieſts?</p>
                  <p n="10">10. How juſt is it with God, to give thoſe up unto an in-judicious mind, who do not ſerve him with their Mind or Judgment?

Now, a Reprobate Mind (or void of Judgment, as the <hi>Greek</hi> word ſignifieth) is one of the ſaddeſt Characters, and ſoreſt Judgments threatned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 28. the fear whereof made <hi>Paul</hi> to mind (himſelf) that which he Preach'd to others, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 27. How ſad would it be, if Hearts ſhould grow wild through wandring; and ſilly, through multiplyed Acts of In-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency; and Carnal, for want of Exerciſing Spiritual Infuſed Habits, which elſe may fall into a great Decay! A Cloſed Eye is juſtly blinded, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 14, 15.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. If Veſſels be not filled with Oyl, they will abound with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe unto our Diſ-advantage: There being no abſolute vacuity or utter emptineſs; and as not in a Natural, ſo neither in this Moral Sence. Hence it is, that ſleighty Profeſſors are of an Airy Spirit at the beſt; yea, even their Mind and Conſcience is Defiled alſo, <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 15. who do profeſs to know God, but in their Works deny him, to every good work being Reprobate, or void of Judgment, <hi>v.</hi> 16. An empty Veſſel is apt to have Puddle-water caſt into it by ſome miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Perſon: And empty Houſes (though never ſo Neatly Garniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) are ſubject to be haunted, or poſſeſs'd by Evil Spirits, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 44, 45. Since while Men ſleep, the Enemy will ſow his Tares, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 25. And therefore if the Heart be not Engaged in a Religious Duty, it is not onely vain, but wicked alſo; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 31. Now, what a ſad thing it is, if we ſhall deny that unto Chriſt, which if he hath not, the Devil will have; and at the worſt time that is, or while we are pretending to be moſt Holily employed, and in Chriſt's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. There is no Oyl at all, unleſs it be in Veſſels, together with the Virgins Lamps, as may be gathered from this Text: To ſignifie
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50213:32"/> that there can be no Grace at all, where good Affections do not proceed from Spiritual Judgment; as there can be no proper Vertue, when Actings and Affections are Morally in-judicious; nor yet right Reaſon, when Words and Actions are wholly deſtitute of Natural Judgment. One part of a wicked Man's Deſcription, is, his not underſtanding Judgment, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 5. and that there is no Judgment in his goings, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 8. and without which Diſcretion, all other fairneſs whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, is but as a Jewel of Gold in the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So that it doth concern Profeſſors to have Oyl in their Veſſels, and to evince it by the Judiciouſneſs of their proceedings in Religious Duties, as they would not be numbred among Tranſgreſſors or Graceleſs Perſons.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. We border upon thoſe Times, wherein our Principles will be enquired after, as well as Practices; which therefore had need be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us, for fear of what may follow. Time was, when <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was but a Child, who then was ſatisfied with Lower things, as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are with Brutes and Babies: But when he became a Man, he put away thoſe Childiſh things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 11.

And we have ground to hope, that wiſer Virgins will for the future be well Adviſed, with whom they walk; ſearching the Veſſels of their Companions, and truſting no more to Trimmed Lamps.

As we would therefore ſtand in God's Holy place, when <hi>David</hi>'s Tabernacle ſhall be reared up; ſo let there be a ſuitableneſs between our Hearts and Hands, or Principles and Practices, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24. 3, 4.</p>

As we would therefore not come under the Fooliſh Virgins Condemnation, ſo let us take heed of their miſcarriage, or truſting to good Affections.</p>
                  <p>In Order whereunto, theſe Helps may be of Uſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Habituate your ſelves to be conſiderate, in every of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon undertakings: Since he that is a raſh or haſty Man, will ſcarcely ever prove a Solid Chriſtian. There is an unruly Spirit, which ſome Men are poſſeſſed with, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. 28. whoſe Cuſtomary In-adverten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Ordinary Matters, doth much more eaſily beſet them in Religious Exerciſes. As a Bodily Temper doth much affect the Natural Spirit; ſo doth a Chriſtian's Duty ſavour of his Natural Diſpoſition: Since Nature is both therein a fellow-worker, and Grace's Elder Brother. A wiſe Man's Heart is wont to teach his Mouth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 23. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his words are Gracious, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10. 12. And if a conſtant Watch were ſet before our Lips, Saints would not want the benefit of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary helps in Extraordinary caſes. But he that is not careful in the leaſt, (ſuch as our Natural concernments are, wherein both Grace and Nature joyn) wilſ much leſs be ſo in the greateſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 10. Such as Religious Matters are, wherein (as to the point of Care) Grace uſually is left alone.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Indulge not your Affections over-much, whoſe proper place is, to be Servants unto the Underſtanding's Dictates; but he that Delicately bringeth up his Servant from a Child, ſhall have him to become his Son at laſt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29. 21.

And if in Natural Reſpects, then much more in a Moral ſence, Men of Inordinate Affections, are generally injudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, becauſe of the Members warring againſt the Mind, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23. which we are therefore bid to Mortifie, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 5. And as Affections are termed Luſts, when fixt upon a ſinful Object; ſo when they are not duly bounded, with reference to what is Good, which yet is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of a Lower Nature; and partly, upon that Account, the Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Virgins might forget to fill their Veſſels, becauſe they did ſo violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Affect the Bridegroom's Coming, upon a Carnal Score.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Behold the Beauty of Judiciouſneſs in Other's Actings, how
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50213:33"/> comely ſuch are in going! Men of a ſleighty Spirit themſelves, will yet bear witneſs unto the ſeemly carriage of another who walks by Judgment. Heart anſwereth unto Heart, as doth the Face (in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) to it ſelf, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 19. That is, there is an Harmony or ſweet Agreement between the Hearts of Men, as is between a Face and its Reflection. How Grateful is Conſiſtency in a Diſcourſe, when one thing correſpondeth with another, and every Expreſſion with the ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's Underſtanding: Yea, we are apt to be in Love with ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, although appearing onely in the Countenance, much more in Words or Actions; and ſuch eſpecially as are of high concernment. Man's Beauty is chiefly ſeated in his Eye, the Rolling whereof (both in a Natural and Moral ſence) disfigureth the faireſt Face; eſpecially when they who ſeem to be Religious, are leaſt attentive unto the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their God. How juſtly do we loath that man, whoſe Heart (we know) agrees not with his Tongue; eſpecially when ſuch egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Nonſence is confidently uttered with ſtrong Affections. This we can ſee in others, which ſhould provoke its greater deteſtation in our ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let us Reflect upon our own Experiences, which are the very Life of Reaſons, and Proof of Demonſtrations. Have we not been oft-times aſhamed of making Enquiry after Vows, by Reaſon of a Raſh En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement? Have not our Hearts oft ſmitten us, for leaving them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, in a Religious Duty? And ſhall we yet feed that Worm of ſleighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which hath ſo gnawn our Conſciences? Whereas on the other ſide, what inward ſatisfaction hath been the conſequent, of pondering what we hear; and pouring out the Soul in Prayer; and of our being in that Duty, which we at any time have been employed about? Indeed how can it be expected, that the Spirit in man ſhould be well pleaſed, ſave as it ſelf is Exerciſed in a Service? Which elſe will ſharply chide, as did thoſe <hi>Ephramites</hi> with <hi>Gideon,</hi> becauſe they were not called to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him in ſuch an Expedition, <hi>Judg.</hi> 8. 1. And as the Judgment is more Spiritual, ſo are the Senſes better Exerciſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 14. To ſmell the ſweetneſs of that Spikenard which Chriſt exciteth, whilſt he is ſitting at the Spouſe's Table, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 12. And if the preſent Taſte hath ſo Refreſh'd us, much more ſhould we remember the benefit of that Digeſtion, which hath attended the calling of our Spirits in, at ſuch a Feaſt; compared with that Leanneſs, which always is the conſequent of having our Heads employed other ways, in Spiritual meal-times, as in a Bodily Reſpect.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Be earneſt with the Lord in Prayer, who is the Father of our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 9. both as he is the Former of them, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 1. and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50213:34"/> as he hath them under his Command, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 1.

Onely this Spirit muſt earneſtly be deſired by us, as Food is by an hungry Child, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 11, 12, 13.

                  <p>Now, the Judiciouſneſs of our proceedings, may be Diſcerned by theſe Signs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That which is done in Judgment, is duely weighed before-hand, as to its Nature, Grounds, Effects, and Requiſites. As to its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they know the Lord, <hi>(Hoſ.</hi> 2. 20.) who are in Judgment betroth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, <hi>v.</hi> 19. whereas he is a Fooliſh Vower, <hi>(Eccl.</hi> 5. 4.) who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards doth ſay (before this Angel) it was an Error, <hi>v.</hi> 6. Such alſo know, what Grounds they do proceed upon, and therefore it is incumbent upon Chriſtians, firſt to Believe, and then to Speak, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13. Yea, and to give a Reaſon of their Hope, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be perſwaded in their Mind before they Practiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 5. And ſuch will firſt ſit down (or mind Effects) before they begin to Build, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 28. In which regard, Chriſt bids him weigh the Conſequents of being his Follower, <hi>Mat:</hi> 8. 20. who was ſo forward in his Offer, <hi>v.</hi> 19. Nor will ſuch make Attempts, till their Ability for ſuch a work be underſtood, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 31. or what is requiſite for ſuch an underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and till it is firſt fitted, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 27.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That which is done in Judgment, is carefully attended unto, in the Doing of it, as need requireth. The words of ſuch, are with Heart-Meditation, before the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. 1. The Conſideration

Judgment is as the Eye, and what a man hath ſeen, he will not queſtion, though all the World ſhould differ from him, in that particular. Judgment is the Root of Actions, which ſhooteth deeper into its ground, when ſhaken with the wind of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. <hi>Paul</hi> Acted from a Principle of Judgment, who knew in whom he had Believed, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 12. and therefore kept the Faith, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7. when all forſook him, <hi>v.</hi> 16. Whilſt <hi>Peter</hi> ran, for Company, <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 50. from under the moſt ſtrong Affectionate pre-obligation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 33. But therefore <hi>Peter</hi> (afterwards) could not but ſpeak what he had ſeen, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 20. though Man forbad him, <hi>v.</hi> 18. whoſe Boldneſs made his Perſecutors to perceive, that he had been with Jeſus, <hi>v.</hi> 13. His Heart was never right with God, who is not ſtedfaſt in his Covenant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 37. Nor had ſuch ever any depth of Root, who finally fall away in times of Tribulation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13 21. Whereas his way ſhall be eſtabliſhed, who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Path is Pondered, <hi>Prov</hi> 3. 26.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That which is done with Judgment, is alſo Ordered with Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; according to the Nature, Time, and other Circumſtances of a Duty. As there are Songs, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 32. Songs of Degrees, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 120. Title; and a Song of Songs, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 1. So there are leſſer and more Weighty Matters, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 23. the latter of which are principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attended unto, by Judicious Practiſers. Such are for Real Truths at any Time, but yet predominant Time-Truths, are chiefly inſiſted on by a Judicious Preacher. If there be any Vertue, it will be thought upon by ſuch, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 8. but yet Faith is the Prime Object of a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Chriſtian's Diligence, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. If Civil Subjection to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Powers, (which is more dark) be bogled at by ſuch, much leſs will Man's Commands, or Prohibitions (in Religious Matters) be complied with; by a Judicious Scrupler; becauſe this latter is more
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50213:35"/> clear. Such will do good to all, but more eſpecially where need doth moſt require; or elſe their Love doth not abound in Knowledge and all Judgment, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That which is done with Judgment, is done with due Affections alſo; the Judgment being alway ſo Accompanied, as Princes are with their Attendants, although Affections oft-times go alone. They who judiciouſly confeſs a failing, (eſpecially ſome kind of ſins) are ſuitably Affected with inward bitterneſs, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. elſe do they not ſeem to know that kind of Plague, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 38. which muſt be driven out with Holy Violence. Such will pour out their Heart in Prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62. 8. eſpecially for Spiritual Bleſſings: Elſe do they not pray with Underſtanding; ſince cold Petitioners (in ſuch Caſes) do onely Teach another to deny them. Such will draw out their Soul (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their Bread) unto the Hungry, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 10. elſe may they give much Alms, as did the <hi>Phariſees, Mat.</hi> 6. 2. who yet omitted Mercy, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 23. becauſe they did it not with Bowels of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion. And ſuch who do judiciouſly return unto an open Teſtimony (in Times of Danger) as their Duty, cannot but be aſhamed of their former failing in that Reſpect; and ſo in any other caſe whatever.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That which Men do with Judgment, they will endeavour to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh, by the diligent uſe of moſt effectual Means conducing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Such are no Idle Beggars, but he that Cryeth after Knowledge (with Underſtanding) will ſeek her alſo, and ſearch for her, as for hid Treaſure, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 3, 4. Temptations Cordially groaned under, are ſtriven againſt, and watched over, elſe do not men judge them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry burdenſome, what-ever may be deceitfully pretended unto. Such alſo ſtudy what to render, for all thoſe Benefits, which are judiciouſly acknowledged by them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 12. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> how to take in their Bonds, and Pay their Vows, which have been made with Underſtanding, <hi>v.</hi> 18. Whereas men guided by meer Affections, are to be known by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsneſs of their Endeavours, and ſluggiſhneſs of their Deſires, and the In-activity of their Acknowledgments. Nor can we better Judge of Heartleſs Hypocrites, than by Obſerving the Diſ-proportion that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their Practice and Profeſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 3.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the Signs of Acting from Judgment, in the General. The Signs of being Spiritually Judicious (in our Religious Actings) are briefly theſe which follow.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Light of Spiritual Judgment, is alſo Univerſal; at leaſt, with reference unto the Main of whatſoever is a Duty. Men Naturally Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dcious, are Uniform, as to the whole of a Particular Action: But that which is truly Spiritual, doth ſuitably appear, in every of a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50213:35"/> Profeſſor's ways. Nature deals by Retail (in Spiritual Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) but Grace by whole S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>le: And therefore he is guided into All Truth, who by the Spirit of Truth is guided into Any one, <hi>John</hi> 16. 13. Grace doth renew the Mind, and caſteth Salt (as did <hi>Eliſha)</hi> into that Spring which healeth every of its Streams or Actions; as Natural Underſtanding doth in Ordinary Caſes, but not Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>igious. No Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict can rightly paſs upon a man, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ut by Accumulation, or taking him altogether, No more than Parrots can be con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>uded Rational, or Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards Sober, from ſome few words which they may utter; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Saints are oft-times called Vines, whoſe Fruit is Cluſtered, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 11.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. True Spiritual Light is of a ſelf-evidencing Nature; like that of the Sun, which needeth no Forreign help, nor can be Diſcern'd by any other, ſave its own Beams; and which the ſtrongeſt Arguments cannot prevail againſt, in his Opinion whoſe Eye is therewith Lightned Such call for no Reaſon, ſave what is Scriptural; nor can they ſee with Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's Spectacles in Spiritual Caſes; nor are they ſhaken in their Faith, by meer Prudential Arguments, or Man's Authority. Thoſe are not Spiritually Judicious, who plead for Nature's Negative Voice upon Divine Commands; or Argue from thence the Warrant of ſelf-preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, when Chriſt (who is the Lord of all, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 36.) expreſly calls for ſelf-denyal. Prophets were therefore counted Mad, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9. 11. and ſo was <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 13. becauſe ſo confident, againſt all Rules of Ordinary Demonſtration; not knowing Chriſt after the Fleſh, as heretofore, <hi>v.</hi> 16. And every Man in Chriſt is thus Renewed, <hi>v.</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. True Spiritual Light is throughly Purifying; And therefore the Spirit of Judgment is alſo called the Spirit of Burning, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4. 4. with reference unto that Droſs and Filth, which it Diſcovereth and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, both at once. Thoſe men who are but Naturally Judicious, may alter their Opinion or former evil Practice, yea, with Affection alſo; and yet without the utter Extirpation of a contrary Principle, As is to be Obſerved in ſome Moraliſts, who yet without the Spirit of Chriſt can never Mortifie a ſinful Luſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 13. But Duty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from Spiritual Judgment, deſtroys the Root of Diſobedience; as doth the Love of Truth, what is Erroneous: Yea, the Confeſſion of a ſin (when it is Spiritually Judicious) doth ſecretly Eradicate that which is ſo acknowledged. Let us Obſerve what Execution is done upon our Spiritual Adverſaries, by every one of our Religious Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as we would Argue our being therein Acted by a Spiritually enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Judgment: Since Chriſt's Peculiar Baptiſm (with the Holy Ghoſt)
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50213:36"/> is of a fiery Nature, and ſo appeareth, by its conſuming what-ever is combu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tible, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 11, 12.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. True Spiritual Light Transforms a Soul into the Nature of what is thereby ſeen or done; it being the Spirit's property to change Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders into the Image of what it doth Diſcover, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>Balaam</hi> did Naturally Underſtand what he denounced upon <hi>Iſraels</hi> Curſers, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24. 9. which yet did not prevent his curſed following Practice, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 14. No more than Notional Acquaintance with Goſpel-Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, can change a Carnal Heart, who yet may Naturally underſtand them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 2. But he that Spiritually (or by the Spirit of Faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13.) believeth in Chriſt, is thereby turned into a New Creature; all things are New, as well as Old things done away, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. Such are Transfigured, as Chriſt was in Prayer, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 29. and are Delivered into what they Hear, as it is in the <hi>Greek, Rom.</hi> 6. 17. becauſe this Spiritual Digeſtion doth Convert a Feeder into the Nature of his Meat, which Natural Underſtanding doth not, but leaves the Heart as void of Spirituality, to be ſure (though not, perhaps, ſo groſly vicious) as it was before.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Men Naturally Judicious, are alway Sober; but Spiritual Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth alſo keep them very Humble, and of a Lowly Heart, with reference to what they either Know or Do. That Knowledge is but Natural at the beſt, which Puffeth up, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 1. And Elevating Duty is not Evangelical, which ſome are apt to Glory in, becauſe they know not wherein true Spirituality doth conſiſt, and how far ſhort they come thereof. But the work of the Spirit is to Mortifie all Fleſhly Luſts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13, and Pride among the reſt, by convincing the Soul of more Myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous failings, <hi>John</hi> 16. 8, 9. comparing Spiritual things with Spiritual, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 13. by preſſing forward, ſo as to make us forgetful of what is behind, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 13, 14. and by affording its ſuper-added help in Holy Exerciſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. all which are of an Humbling Nature. How can he Boaſt, whoſe work is ſeen (by the Spirit's Light) to be imperfect, and full of Blemiſhes? Yet, who doth ſee, he worketh not, as unto that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Glory of his work conſiſteth. They who are apt to be Tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, do not appear to be Judicious, at leaſt, not Spiritually.</p>

So will it be Obſerved by him, unto a ſelf-ſame Day, as when he brought <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> Exod. 12. 41. which muſt be Acted over a Second time, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 11.

                  <p>II. But then Affirmatively; Chriſt may be ſaid to Tarry, (or to Prolong his Time, as the <hi>Greek</hi> word ſignifieth) in theſe Reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

Now, all theſe Virgins did earneſtly wiſh for the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom's Coming, at their firſt going out; from whence their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him might ariſe, and conſequently their ſuppoſal of his Tarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beyond the Time.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Partly from probable Grounds, both Scriptural and Providential. His Coming (at their firſt going out) was Generally the Object of their Faith and Prayer, with whom God's ſecret is, who therefore might conclude his ſpeedy Coming <hi>Then,</hi> from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 14. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 7, 8. His Servants (at that time) took Pleaſure in <hi>Sion</hi>'s Stones, as was apparent from their Endeavouring <hi>Then</hi> to Build them up, with greateſt Hazard, Induſtry and Alacrity: who therefore might ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the Time (yea, the ſet Time) was come, from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. 13, 14. The many wondrous works of God (relating unto the Time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned) did much encourage to believe the near approaching of Chriſt's Name or Diſpenſation, from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75. 1, 2. The falling
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50213:37"/> of ſo many Stars (at ſuch a Time,) did comfortably evidence, that this Sign of the Son of Man, was even at the Doors, from <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 29, 30, 33. The Witneſſes have been ſignally warred with, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 7. which War doth properly import their being uppermoſt, or upon equal terms; and therefore it might be Then preſumed, the Kingdom ſhould not be left to other People, from <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 44. No wonder then if Expectations were ſo high.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Principally, becauſe they were not aware of Chriſt's fore-runner, with reference unto his Coming as a Bridegroom, which is ſufficiently hinted in the Scriptures: And after which Harbinger, his Proper Coming will be uſhered in, by ſuch a ſad ſtate of things, as we have met with. Thus Chriſt himſelf was ſlain, after his being Proclaimed King, by his Diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 37, 38. As <hi>David</hi> was purſued by <hi>Saul,</hi> after his having been Annointed King by <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 13. And as after the Saints being called Earthly Kings, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24. 21. they muſt be gathered together as Priſoners in the Pit, <hi>v.</hi> 22. as <hi>Joſeph</hi> was, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. 22. After that his Supremacy was firſt Declared, <hi>v.</hi> 9. And after that <hi>Sion</hi>'s ſet time is come, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. 13. there will be a ſore Reproach, <hi>v.</hi> 8. Drink mingled with weeping, <hi>v.</hi> 9. a Caſting down, after a being lifted up, <hi>v.</hi> 10. groaning Priſoners, and ſome Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Dye, <hi>v.</hi> 20. Yea, after the fourth Beaſt's being ſlain in the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Horn, the reſt of the Beaſts (or a groſſer intereſt) will in ſome ſence ſurvive, though they have no Dominion (or proper ſettlement) in Scripture-phraſe, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 11, 12. And when the Witneſſes are Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and Aſcended, or have Received their Kingdom, as Chriſt did upon his Aſcention, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 12. then comes that dreadful Earthquake, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 12, 13. which Term<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Now, though an Hypocrite will not pray alway, <hi>Job.</hi> 27. 10. yet tarrying is an Incentive to a Cordial ſeeker, who is not ſilent in the Night, although his Cry (the Day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) hath not been heard, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 2. Yea, therefore ſuch will pray more earneſtly, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 44.

                  <p n="3">3. Chriſt therefore Tarrieth at ſuch a Time, becauſe his own ſet Time is not Then come: Which Time (in ſuch a Caſe) is not for us to know, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 7. Our Time is (in ſuch Caſes) always ready, ſo is not his, <hi>John</hi> 7. 6. who will not come, untill the fulneſs of his Time be come, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. till when, a Thouſand Years (with him) are as one Day; but when that Time is come, one Day is as a Thouſand Years, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 8. That is, he will not Tarry, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 37. Nor is it any juſt matter of Grief to us, that Chriſt thus tarryeth, ſince Fruits are ſweeteſt, when fully Ripe: However it is no cauſe of Wonder, ſince Mercy muſt give place to Truth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138. 2. and therefore thoſe Days of Tribulation are no whit ſhorter, than as was fore-determined, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 21, 22.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That ſo his Coming might be with greater State, after the manner of Earthly Kings, whoſe Motion therefore is not too quick, and who are therefore wont to have an Harbinger, as Chriſt hath alſo, which cannot but Occaſion ſome kind of tarrying. Chriſt's Spiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was thus Uſhered in, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 3. much more (then) muſt his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Kingdom be ſo Attended, becauſe the Glory of this latter will be more Viſible. And though Chriſt's Coming (in this Parable) will be but ſuch an Harbinger, compared with his Perſonal Coming, yet this fore-runner (compared with it ſelf) will alſo have its Meſſenger, when Chriſt ſhall come into his Temple, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 1. which Temple is not in being at his Perſonal Coming, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 22. And thus <hi>Elias</hi> muſt firſt come, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 12. untill the ending of whoſe Miniſtration, the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom tarrieth. Poor Virgins would fain have had him come forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, but that would not ſo well have ſuited his deſigned Kingly State.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That ſo the Fooliſh Virgins might be Diſcovered. Chriſt alway cometh with his Fan, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 12. and Fullers Soap and Fire, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 2. which they muſt be brought under, who are not abſolutely cut off,

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt Tarryeth to make his Jewels up, or that Men might Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern between the Righteous and the Wicked, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 17, 18.

And which had not been ſo Apparent, in Caſe he had come Then. All ſorts of Virgins (at their firſt going out) were in their Prime, their Lamps were very Trim, and their Affections much let out in way of Prayer and Zeal for Chriſt. So that his Coming then might have been thought to be Deſerved, Men are ſo apt to Magnifie their Duty; and therefore (poſſibly) his Coming in that Nick of Time was verily Expected by them with ſo much Confidence. But he doth chooſe to tarry till all thoſe Virgins be aſleep, that ſo it might appear to be an Act of double Grace, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>viz.</hi> with reference to their unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs at the preſent, as well as with reſpect to any Natural Tye that was upon him at the firſt.</p>

The tryal of whoſe Faith is much more precious than that of Gold, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 7. Now, had Chriſt come at firſt, this tryal had not been made: Whereas his tarrying doth Experiment what they will ſay, as to the Promiſe of his Coming; whether they will Repent of former Duty, becauſe their Recompence is not ſo ſpeedy; now they can wait one hour beyond the utmoſt of their Expectation, how they can bear to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided, becauſe Events are not according to their Hopes; whether their Faith was grounded upon the Scriptures, or mainly upon uncertain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences; what they will ſay, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> falls before the King of <hi>Ai,</hi> in their own Land of Promiſe? What they will do, when Tempted to deny their Ancient Maſter? Whether they can believe the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of a Dying cauſe? Or how they can Return (with <hi>David)</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a former low Condition, after their having been Advanced? And how the Valley of <hi>Achor</hi> (in theſe latter days) can be a Door of Hope.</p>

                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:50213:39"/> 8. That Servants (of a Lower Rank) might have that Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, both for their Work and Wages, diſtinct from that of Sons, which otherwiſe could not have been effected. As in a Great Houſe, there are ſome Veſſels to Honour, and ſome to Diſhonour, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 20. So Chriſt hath both his Saints and Sanctified ones, whoſe Work and Wages are Diſtinct, both in Reſpect of Worth and Time. The Lord will give a Banner to them that fear him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 60. 4. And <hi>Judah</hi> alſo ſhall be employed at <hi>Jeruſalem, Zech.</hi> 14. 14. Such Honour have all the Saints, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149. 9.

So meaner Servants muſt have their Temporary Gifts before that Year of Liberty, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 46. 17.

                  <p n="9">9.

Yea, thoſe Diſciples of a choiſer Spirit will alſo Rejoyce in their Prolonged Sufferings, till that which is behind (of Chriſt's Afflictions, in their fleſh) be filled up, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 24. Now, had Chriſt come at firſt, <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> had not been a Priſoner; and many Late Sufferers would not have come upon the Stage, ſince groſſer Perſecutions (or Deſtructions) will come to a Perpetual end, when Chriſt ſhall have prepared his Throne for Judgment, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 6, 7. There would not elſe have been thoſe Hopeful Priſoners for him to ſend forth, and render double unto, <hi>Zech.</hi> 9. 11, 12. when he ſhall come as King, <hi>v</hi> 9.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The Lord is therefore <hi>Slack,</hi> (or rather long-ſuffering) becauſe he is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but would have all come to Repentance, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9. as <hi>Paul</hi> came not (as yet) to thoſe <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> from a Deſign to ſpare them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 23. and not from any Lightneſs, <hi>v.</hi> 17. The ſaving of thoſe <hi>Samaritans</hi> did countervail his Tarrying, <hi>John</hi> 4. 40, 41. Yea, therefore <hi>Paul</hi> endured much for the Elects ſake, that they might alſo obtain Salvation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 10. And thoſe Old Saints might not receive the Promiſe in their Days, God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving provided ſome better thing for us, that they without us ſhould not be made Perfect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 39, 40.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I. As to the Difference between theſe two, it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered two ways. Either firſt, with Reſpect unto their Nature; and ſo all know that Slumbring is leſs than Sleeping, as being but an Entry into the Sleeper's Houſe. A Slumberers Senſes are not ſo faſt bound up, but that he can hear ſome greater Noiſe, and underſtand what is ſaid or done, and give ſome kind of Anſwer; yea, have ſome ſtirring of Affections, and be awakened ſooner than he that's faſt aſleep: Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Spouſe, whoſe Heart was then awake, therefore her Sleep was but a Slumber, <hi>Cant,</hi> 5. 2. becauſe ſhe then could hear the Knock of her Beloved, and underſtand his Voyce, <hi>v.</hi> 2. and gave ſome kind of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50213:41"/> Anſwer, <hi>v.</hi> 3. Yea, had ſome Moving in her Bowels for him, <hi>v.</hi> 4. and preſently awakened ſo, as that ſhe aroſe and Opened to him, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. This ſhews the Difference that is between them, as to their Nature. Secondly, this Difference may be conſidered, as to their Uſe or Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation here, unto thoſe Virgins; which may be double.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In a way of Diſtribution, or ſo, as that the Fooliſh Virgins ſlept, whereas the Wiſe did onely ſlumber. And ſuch a Diſtinction may eaſily be ſuppoſed, ſince Folly (or Weakneſs) doth much incline un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Deeper kind of Sleep, as is to be Obſerved in ſilly Aged People and little Children. Saints are not wont to be ſo altogether heavy Headed as others are who want their rouzing Heat, and many other Soul-awakening Helps, which Grace affordeth. Saints are (all of them) Children of the Day, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 5. but they that Sleep, Sleep in the Night, <hi>v.</hi> 7. Chriſt keepeth his Diſciples waking with frequent Jogs, <hi>Luke</hi> 22, 46. Yea, their own Conſcience is an Alarm to them. Slothfulneſs caſts ſinners into a deep Sleep, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 15. but Saints have ſomething elſe to do, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132. 4. Nor will their Riches ſuffer them to ſleep, like other poor Creatures, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5. 12. Therefore this ſleep and ſlumber may be thus Diſtributed among the Virgins here; which is one way of Underſtanding them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It may be taken in a way of ſhewing how ſleep at laſt did ſeize upon them all, <hi>viz.</hi> by ſlumbring at the firſt, or that they all firſt ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, and ſo at laſt fell faſt aſleep. As we would not give ſleep unto our Eyes, ſo we ſhould not give ſlumber to our Eye lids, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 4. The latter of which is but a Needle, which will ſoon ſtitch our Eyes together. Therefore Chriſt bad his Diſciples Watch, for fear of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into Temptation, <hi>viz.</hi> by giving way unto their ſlumbrings, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 41. Sluggards (both in the Letter and Myſtery) plead onely for a little ſleep, a little ſlumber, a little folding of the Hands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 10. But we are taught (from what the Virgins have Experienced) to be more Wiſe, than to crave Liberty of Leaping up unto the Knees in the Ocean. And thus the Difference between theſe two is briefly Opened, both as to their Nature, and Application.</p>
                  <p>II. As to the Particular Caſes here referred unto, theſe Virgins may be ſaid to ſlumber and ſleep, as followeth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. With Reſpect to common Principles of Truth and Righteouſneſs, which formerly have been avouched. Time was, when Reaſon and Scripture-proof have been demanded inſtead of Major Vote, or meer Humane Authority. A Fundamental Publick Good hath been prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the moſt Ancient Cuſtom, Higheſt Worldly Form, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Intereſt of any Man whatever. Right Goſpel Churches, Truths,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50213:42"/> and Ordinances, have not been ſometime Judged of according to the Fleſh, or by the Numerouſneſs of their Abettors, but by Agreement with the Rule. It heretofore hath been Accounted ſin to fail in Duty, though Ignorant thereof; or though (at leaſt) one be not Spirited thereunto, but now the Caſe is altered. There was a general Cry (at firſt) for Liberty of Conſcience in Matters of a Religious Nature, which when ſome Men had gained for themſelves, how did they vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thoſe very Arguments (in others Mouths) and break that Sword in pieces by which themſelves had been Defended.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. With reference unto their ſometime Zeal for Chriſt, and againſt the Man of ſin; ſubjection unto Commands and Prohibitions in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Matters hath been Accounted onely due to Chriſt, which yet o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> later Years hath been thought yieldable unto Man without his being Deified. Some Men have ſeparated from thoſe ſuppoſed Churches, whoſe Acts of Office (and conſequently their Eſſence) have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed <hi>valid,</hi> which ſince hath been denyed by them to others, unti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> the Eſſence (as well as Purity) of their own Churches be Deſtroyed. Did ſome Men ever think they ſhould have been free to ſwear (by ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequence) the Preſervation of that Hierarchy which they had formerly Declared to be Antichriſtian? Time was when ſuch were loth to uſe Chriſt's Form of Prayer, who ſince could hear Humane Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Liturgies; And they who ſometimes preſſed hard for Purity i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Communion, could ſince endure to walk with thoſe who have returned to their Ancient Vomit, and have not caſt them out.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. With reference unto their Entertainment of Chriſt's Little ones, ſuch as Time, Truths, and Duties are. Some have been bold (of later Years) to Queſtion the Being of Time-Truths at all, who yet doubt not the Truth of ſomething which ſcarce had any Being before their Time. Others would grant that Name to be abiding ſtill, but not its Application, ſave unto what was Fanſied and Approved by themſelves. Others would yield that Application alſo, which ſome contended for, who yet thought other common Truths more Profitable to be inſiſted on, though little elſe (but ſuch as theſe) was ſometimes urged by themſelves, and ſuch Diſcourſes then were counted-Edifying; yea, very great ſtreſs was laid thereon by all the Virgins at their firſt going out. But ſince that time ſucceeding Infants of this Nature have much been over-looked (if not over-layed) by our Sleepers, and their poor Nurſes have been Offended ſadly.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. With reference unto their former Courage and ſelf-denyal in the way of Duty. How boldly did theſe Virgins ſometime Talk and Write, unto the Hazard of their All, who ſince have quarrelled with
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50213:42"/> the very Name of Self-adventuring. Time was when Suffering Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was thought moſt Honourable, but ſince that time, if Active Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be more ſafe, it hath been ſet before the other. Chriſt's Inſtituted Worſhip hath been thought worth the loſs of Life, but that (of late) was counted Lawful to be Diſpenſed with, if but Eſtate or Liberty were by that means endangered. How will ſome (one day) be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of fearing the Oppreſſor's Fury, when it ſhall (tauntingly) be ſaid unto them, <hi>Where is the Fury of the Oppreſſor,</hi> Iſa. 51. 13? Yea, they who ſometimes have not feared many Deaths in the Open Field, have ſince been frighted from their Duty by a Priſon. Nor is it to be wondred at, if waking Little Children be in the Exerciſe of greater ſtrength than Giants that are faſt aſleep.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. With reference unto their ſometime Faith and Hope, as to the Bridegroom's Coming. At their firſt going out how did the Pulpits ring with <hi>Babylon</hi>'s Funeral Sermons! Yea, Civil Conſtitutions were alſo threatned with being ſhaken in pieces, as ſome then Witneſſed; nor was there ſo much ſtriving (then) againſt the fifth Monarchy-Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, as who ſhould be the Men; Chriſt's Coming was (at that time) ſo generally expected. But ſince that time, where is (ſaid ſome) the Promiſe of his Coming, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 4? It is Delayed, ſaith ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 48. We had great Hopes (ſaid ſome of his Diſciples) we Truſted it had been He, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 21. But that Expected Child (ſaid others) hath proved a falſe Conception, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 18. Not ſo, I hope, (ſaith <hi>Hezekiah)</hi> onely there is not Strength to bring it forth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37. 3. No, no, (ſaith <hi>Sion)</hi> the Lord hath forſaken me, my God hath quite forgotten, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 14. Thus hath there been a Mighty Cry, but yet no Faith on Earth, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 7, 8. whilſt others of a more Believing Spirit have been for Signs and Wonders, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 18. And if it now be otherwiſe, 'tis either from ſome preſent Dream, or from the Virgins late awaking.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. With reference unto their former Accurateneſs, or walking cloſely with the Lord, as doth become the Goſpel. Time was when all our Virgins were very Sober, ſeeming to be of a ſerious Spirit, not ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in Worldly buſineſſes, willing to hear what might be Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Diligent in Religious Exerciſes, and trembling to think of groſſer failings, in point of Practice or Opinion. But ſince that time how have they fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nted it in Worldly Faſhions, making Proviſion for the Fleſh: What Levity hath appeared in their Spirits, and Frothineſs in their Diſcourſe? How hath their Cloven Foot United, having Buried their General in their Particular Calling? How have they ſcorn'd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, at leaſt, to be Reproved? How yawningly hath God been
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50213:43"/> Worſhipped, whilſt <hi>Mammon</hi> hath had the Male? Yea, how have Dangerous Errors been Indulged, and Groſſer breach of Duty made light of? Thus have the Wiſer Virgins ſlumbred, whilſt others have fallen faſt aſleep.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="question">
                  <head>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4. What are the Diſtinct or Proper Signs of ſlumbring and ſleeping?</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I. The Signs of ſlumbring (ſuitable to what is in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The ſlumberers Eyes are cloſed, who therefore cannot ſee, unleſs it be ſome little glimmering of a greater Light that's juſt before them: Whereas the wakers Eye is Open, who therefore ſeeth at a diſtance, and can diſcern what is more darkly hinted, by ſending forth to meet the Object, and in a way of Prying Obſervation. But ſlumberers can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand ſome kind of Truths and Duties which formerly were very plain, ſave as their preſent Luſtre can penetrate a ſhut Eye-lid, or not without ſome more than Neceſſary Demonſtration. Time was when all our Virgins were fully ſatisfied concerning ſeveral things, which ſince they ſay are not ſo clear; the Reaſon whereof is more to be Lamented, than to be wondred at, <hi>viz.</hi> The Heavineſs of their Eyes, which muſt be throughly firſt awakened before they can ſee the Glory of Chriſt's altered Countenance, or of thoſe Men who talk of Sufferings, <hi>Luke</hi> 29. 30, 31, 32.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſlumberer's Poſture is very much wavering, this and the other way, untill ſuch either be awakened, or elſe laid down to ſleep. Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men can ſtand whole Days and Nights, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 21. 8. but others are toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to and fro; one while enclining to Prophaneneſs on the Left hand, another while to Right-hand Superſtitions; ſometimes too forward, and preſently fallen back as much behind. Seers may be for Going on unto Perfection, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1. therefore all kind of Alterations are not to be Condemned: But one may eaſily Diſtinguiſh between the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's walking and the Slumberer's Nodding; between a Judicious va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation and Childiſh inſtability. When Perſons do thus Multiply ſelf-contradicting Motions, or when their Head hath loſt its due conſiſtency in Matteres of Faith or Duty, we may conclude them to be ſlumbring, eſpecially if they have formerly been more Diſcreet and Fixed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The ſlumberer's Hand is eaſily apt to let things go or fall, who thereupon awakeneth, unto his Fruitleſs ſorrow. A watchful Chriſtian is to be known by holding faſt that which he hath Received, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 2, 3. eſpecially what is of worth, and of a Brittle Nature, ſuch as are the ſtedfaſt Profeſſion of our Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 23. the Confidence of our Hope unto the End, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 6. the Form of ſound words, or Scripture-Language,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50213:43"/> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. the word of Chriſt's Patience, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 10, 11. and every Goſpel-Inſtitution, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 25. yea, whatſoever is good and true, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 21. or that good thing (be it what it will be) which is Committed to his care, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 14. But ſlumberers may ſoon have ſuch things wreſted from them; yea, of themſelves (by little and little) they will let fall what hath been ſometimes high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prized, and then awaken, when in ſome ſence it is too late. How ſadly Remiſs (of later Years) have the moſt of Virgins been, as to their Ancient Teſtimony, the Purity of their Communion, the Savou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs of their Diſcourſe, their ſearching after Knowledge, and the like; all which evinceth their having entred into this ſad Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Slumberers may Hear, and underſtand a little, but ſuch are not Affected duly with what is ſaid or done. Such can endure to hear their ſcruples Anſwered, their Duty Opened, their Sin Reproved, and yet have no Impreſſion (to any purpoſe) upon their Spirits. They may have ſluggiſh good deſires, and yet have nothing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 4. becauſe their hands are folded, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 10. there way is as an Hedge of Thorns, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 19. there is (ſay ſuch) a Lion in the way of Action, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 13. and therefore their deſire kills them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 25. Such may be heard to groan in Prayer, with reference unto ſome Corruptions, but take no further courſe to be Delivered: They like ſuch kind of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Food, but that it grieves them to bring their Hand and Mouth together, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 15. therefore ſuch Roaſt not what they have ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take in Hunting, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12. 27. <hi>Lord evermore give us this Bread,</hi> ſay ſuch, <hi>John</hi> 6. 34. but do not eat it, when ſet before them, <hi>v.</hi> 35, 36. Whereas a watchful Chriſtian hath his Affections ſtirring, and is in an immediate fit Capacity for ſuitable Actings, as in that caſe of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 36.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Slumberers may ſometimes ſpeak, but very ſimply; witneſs the ſlumbring Spouſe, whoſe Anſwer to her Beloved's Voice was like that of a Child, as if ſhe knew not how to Dreſs her ſelf, or how to put that on, which was put off, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 2, 3. They ſeem to Pray in the Spirit, but not with Underſtanding, not knowing what they ſay, no more than <hi>Peter</hi> did, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 33. when half aſleep, <hi>v.</hi> 32. They will confeſs, if ſuch a Rule were followed, God would be Glorified more, yet will they not grant it to be their Duty. Another's Ruining of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and Family, (in a common caſe) will be acknowledged to be his Liberty, but not his bounden Duty, for fear themſelves ſhould then be made to Suffer with him. They heartily could wiſh that all were free to Suffer in ſuch a cauſe; till when, they Judge it not incumbent upon
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50213:44"/> particular Perſons, as if anothers failing might warrant mine. They will Declare compliances with Man's Commands or Prohibitions to be unlawful, and yet themſelves perſiſt in ſuch a way. Whereas a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Chriſtian is to be known by that conſiſtency which is between his Heart and Tongue, his Practice and Profeſſion.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Slumberers will oft-times waken, and yet immediately will Nod again, both in the Letter and Myſtery. A ſudden Light may rouze ſuch up a little, as did <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s Light thoſe ſlumbring Jews, which made them Skip or Dance a Galliard, though onely for an hour, as the <hi>Greek</hi> there hath it, <hi>John</hi> 5. 35. and as his Diſpenſation (in our Days) hath wrought upon ſome others, who ſince that time have ſlept again. Much more will ſuch be ſtartled with a ſudden Noiſe, ſuch as is that of a Terrible Word, or louder Providential Knocks: All which were ſoon forgotten by Ancient <hi>Iſrael, Pſal.</hi> 78. 11. though God had ſlain ſome of them, and had Redeemed the reſt, <hi>v.</hi> 34, 35, 36, 37. But moſt of all, ſuch may be made to look about them when they are ſtruck, or nipt, or Perſonally (although more gently) touched; as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did, when ſtruck with God's own Hand, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8. 8. but was at his old work again, <hi>v.</hi> 15. as <hi>Ahab</hi> did, when ſorely nipt with that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 42, 43. but preſently Nodded into a greater ſin, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 2. 4. 13. 16. and as the Diſciples did, when touch'd by Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 7, 8. whom he then kept awake, elſe had they ſlept again, as at another time they did, ſo ſoon as his back was turned upon them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 43.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Slumberers cannot endure ſome kind of ſudden, loud, or diſmal Noiſes. One muſt begin with ſuch, a great way off, as <hi>Nathan</hi> did with ſlumbring <hi>David,</hi> who elſe would not have born too ſudden a Rebuke, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 1. 7. Such muſt be gently dealt with at the firſt, elſe drou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie Carnal <hi>Iſraelites</hi> will be Diſturbed, in caſe the Trumpet's Voice be very loud, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 16. They muſt have ſmooth things ſpoken to them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 10. elſe will they be Offended, as were the <hi>Phariſees</hi> when Chriſt ſpake harſhly to them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 7. 12. Whereas a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Chriſtian is not ſurpriſed with Chriſt's ſudden Knock, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 36. but can immediately then ſay, <hi>Loe, this is he,</hi> becauſe they have wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25. 9. Nor are ſuch Paſſionately affected with the Loudneſs of his Voice, becauſe they fain would hear and underſtand it. Nor is their Head Diſquieted with ſmiting reprehenſions, becauſe it is according to their Expectation and Deſire, if need requireth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141. 5.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Slumberers cannot endure the Light, eſpecially in caſe it be too nigh, too Glorious, or uncertain in its ſhining. Such will Approve an
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50213:44"/> Open Teſtimony in Others, or in the General, but not with Reſpect unto Their Times or Perſons; 'tis not the Nature (ſo much as Near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) of that Light which doth Offend them. Such will confeſs Church-Members ſhould be Saints, but that they ſhould be more than Babes in Chriſt, is ſomewhat too Glorious a Diſcovery for ſome awakened ones, much more for Slumberers. Such are for Hoping to the End, ſo long as Providential Grounds are ſteady; but if thoſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the Light of this Duty is ſo uncertain, as that it doth Diſquiet them, who fain would ſlumber untill the Day break, without Diſpute. Therefore ſuch gladly would have that Light removed till ſuch a Time, and then it will be Acceptable, as Chriſt was to the Converted Jews, though it was ſtill a burden unto others, who Laboured under a Spirit of Slumber, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 8.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the Signs of <hi>Slumbering.</hi> The Signs of <hi>Sleeping</hi> are as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Men faſt aſleep can hardly Hear, and to be ſure, not See at all; Sleep being that which bindeth up the Outward Senſes altogether; as in this Moral ſence it was with thoſe on whom the Spirit of a Deep ſleep was poured out, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 10. Such muſt be loudly cryed unto, elſe can they Hear no more than <hi>Baal</hi> did, becauſe (as <hi>Elijah</hi> ſaid, by way of Holy taunt) <hi>He, peradventure, was aſleep,</hi> 1 Kings 18. 27. Such do not ſee thoſe Angels who Obſerve unſeemly Geſtures in Religious Exerciſes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 10. nor how Chriſt walketh among the Golden Candleſticks, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 1. nor how their ſhame is ſeen by others, elſe would they watch, and keep their Garments, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 15. <hi>John</hi> ſaw Chriſt's Glory, <hi>John</hi> 1. 14. but ſo did not the Jews, who therefore ſlept whilſt this Sun ſhone full in their Faces, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 13. 15. and ſo it is ſtill, with reference unto his Intereſts, though one would wonder that People do not perceive the eaſineſs of his Yoak, (compared with that of Satan and the Man of ſin) both in Relation to his Spiritual, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, and Temporal Kingdom, but onely that their Faces are, as it were, hid from him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 3. and Eyes are cloſed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Men faſt aſleep are apt to Dream, and thereupon to Laugh or Weep, when many times there is no cauſe, but what is of a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Nature, unto the Aggravating of their Grief and Shame when once they come to be awakened. We may conclude thoſe Men to be aſleep, who Dream of Eating when they are faint, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 8. who call their Lying Dreams the Word of God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 28. or who are filthy Dreamers, <hi>Jude</hi> 8. pretending unto an Intereſt in Chriſt, and yet will turn his Grace into Laſciviouſneſs, <hi>v.</hi> 4. So on the other ſide, they who were in a Dream when <hi>Babylon</hi>'s Captivity was returned, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:50213:45"/> 126. 1. and did evince it by their Weeping, when there was Ground for Joy, or when the Foundation of the Second Houſe was laid, <hi>Ezra</hi> 3. 12. as in a way ſuitable to that Type, ſome Old Profeſſors in our days have done, whoſe very Age diſpoſeth (as in the Letter) to Sleep and Dream. But whilſt ſuch ſleep at Prayer, they are not wont to Dream of Hell, or how poor <hi>Eutychus</hi> was likely to have never waken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 10. Nor are their Affections Exerciſed according to Subſtantial Grounds, or as the Caſe indeed requireth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sleep makes the Greateſt Giant as unactive, and as unable to help himſelf or others, as is the Weakeſt Child: Therefore Men of an Active Spirit are deſcribed by their not ſleeping, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 27. Yea, God himſelf (when Active for his People) is ſaid to be Awaked, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 65. Till when, Chriſt's Preſence with his Diſciples did not profit them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 24, 25, 26. Nor can his Poverty be prevented who loveth ſleep, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 13. Some are as Lions, in point of Strength, provided they be awake; but when the Horſe and Chariot are caſt into a ſleep, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76. 6. then are the ſtout-hearted ſpoyled, and none of the Men of Might can find their Hands, <hi>v.</hi> 5. Such cannot prevent their Falling down from a Third Loft, though taken up Dead, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 9. and never likely to be Recovered but by a Miracle, <hi>v.</hi> 10. Thoſe Men are faſt aſleep, whoſe Arms are folded, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 10. whoſe Field is over-grown with Thorns, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 30, 31. 33. who do not riſe up from the Dead, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 14. who put not their Beautiful Garments on, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 1. or do not awake to Righteouſneſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 34. eſpecially at ſuch a Time as this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 12, 13.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Men faſt aſleep know not what doth befall them, or is done unto them, although in never ſo Material a Reſpect. Such may be Robbed of a Rib, as <hi>Adam</hi> was, (or of their ſtrength) and yet without any apprehended pain, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 21. Yea, ſuch may be deprived of all their former ſtrength, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> was (together with his Locks) whilſt <hi>Delilah</hi> made him ſleep upon her Knees, <hi>Judg.</hi> 16. 19. The Enemy may come and ſow his Tares among their Wheat who are aſleep, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 25. which will not be rooted again, <hi>v.</hi> 30. ſo long as this World continueth, <hi>v.</hi> 39. Yea, ſuch may have a Dead Child (or one of Satan's Brats) laid in their Boſom inſtead of one alive; as had that Woman while ſhe ſlept, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. 20. Such may be in Danger of being Slain, as <hi>Saul</hi> was, when faſt aſleep, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. 7, 8. who loſt his Spear, and yet he knew it not, <hi>v.</hi> 21. Yea, ſuch (being ſoftly gone unto) may have a Nail driven into their very Temples, as <hi>Siſera</hi> had when he was faſt aſleep, <hi>Judg.</hi> 4. 21. Thoſe Men are more than Slumberers, who are not deeply ſenſible (at that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50213:45"/> very inſtant) of ſuch like Spiritual Loſſes and Hazards run.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Men faſt aſleep are apt to be ſecure, though in the midſt of ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Dangers; as ſleeping Drunkards are upon a top-Maſt, and in the midſt of the Sea, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 30. 34, and as poor ſleeping <hi>Jonah</hi> was, when the Ship was almoſt broken, and Heathen Mariners cryed every Man unto his God, <hi>Jonah</hi> 1. 4, 5. Such have Gray hairs upon them here and there, and yet they know it not, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7. 9. Feaſting and making Merry, when at the very Gates of Death, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22. 13. The Day of the Lord is Darkneſs, and not Light to them, yet do they Ignorantly deſire it, <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 18. although not likely to ſtand at his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 1, 2. Yea, ſuch will Eat and Drink, and Buy and Sell, and Plant and Build, untill the Son of Man doth Come, (as in the days of <hi>Lot</hi> and <hi>Noah)</hi> unto their utter overthrow, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 26. 28. 30. Whereas a watchful Chriſtian is conſtantly at work with Holy Fear, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12. not being ſecure, though in no viſible Danger, <hi>Job</hi> 3. 25, 26. but Trembling in himſelf when ſpeaking of God's Salvation for his Annointed People, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 13. 16. How would it ſtartle ſome aſleep, could they but ſee how daily Induſtrious, and ſelf-ſuſpitious others are, whoſe work is yet already done, as to the Main there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Men faſt aſleep are apt to be awakened with much Affrightment, upon ſome rouzing Noiſe or Accidents; as that poor Jaylor was, who being awakened with an Earthquake, and ſeeing the priſon-doors open, drew out his Sword, and would have killed himſelf, ſuppoſing the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners had been fled, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 26. 27. Such being pricked at the Heart, are ſubject to cry, with ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yea, to lay violent Hands upon themſelves, as <hi>Judas</hi> did, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 5. or at leaſt, Deſperately to ſay, with <hi>Cain,</hi> My ſin is greater than that it may be forgiven, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 13. as the Margin there hath it, and as the ſame <hi>Hebrew</hi> words are elſewhere rendred, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 5. <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. 17. <hi>Exod.</hi> 10. 17. And if Judge <hi>Felix</hi> Trembled when <hi>Paul,</hi> a Priſoner, did but Reaſon at his Bar concerning the future Day of Judgment, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 25. much more will ſuch be ſtartled, when awakened out of their preſent ſleep, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 2. and made to appear before Chriſt's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Seat, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. to receive their dreadful Sentence, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 41.

Whereas a watchful Chriſtian can bear Convictions without Aſtoniſhment, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. 2. and will have Confidence at Chriſt's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 28. being able immediately to Open to him when he ſhall come and knock, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 36.</p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 5. How are we to Interpret that word [All] with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto the Virgins, &amp; their being over-taken with this Temptation?</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This word [All] is of a Diverſe Acceptation, of uſe to be Obſerved.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It ſometimes ſignifieth ſome of All ſorts, where there is any Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution made, as of theſe Virgins into Wiſe and Fooliſh. Thus Chriſt is ſaid to have taſted Death (with reference to its ſpecial Benefits) for All or Every Man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9. as he did ſometimes heal All Sickneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and Every Diſeaſe among the People, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 23. That is, ſome of All ſorts, or all Manner thereof, as it is there Tranſlated, which is the ſame <hi>Greek</hi> word as in the other place. Thus alſo [All the World] is ſometimes uſed; as when <hi>John</hi> (Writing to the Jews) calls Chriſt a Propitiation, not onely for Their ſins, but alſo for the ſins of the whole World, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 2. <hi>viz.</hi> for ſome of All ſorts, both Jews and Gentiles; which Gentiles (Diſtinct from Jews) are ſometimes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the World, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 12.) and not with reſpect to Every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual in the World, ſince Chriſt is onely a Propitiation through Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. which Faith All Men have not, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 2. In which ſence alſo Chriſt lightneth every Man, <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. if meant of Spiritual Light, ſince ſome have not the Spirit, <hi>Jude</hi> 19. But [All the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins] in my Text, is meant of more than ſome of All ſorts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By this word [All] ſometimes the whole (or Every Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al) is intended, without the leaſt Reſtriction or Limitation. Thus <hi>All</hi> (as in the <hi>Greek)</hi> or whoſoever believeth in Chriſt, ſhall not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, <hi>John</hi> 3. 15. and thus the Promiſe is ſure to All the Seed which is of the Faith of <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4. 16. And thus All <hi>Iſrael</hi> (in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) ſhall at laſt be ſaved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 26. Thus alſo is Marriage Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable in All, without excepting any, in competition with Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 4. And thus All Scripture (and every part thereof, unto a word or ſyllable) is given by Holy Inſpiration, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. But as the former ſence was too Reſtrictive, ſo is this Second too Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive to be intended in my Text; as if All Virgins or Profeſſors (not any one excepted) are then aſleep, or ſlumbring, ſince there would elſe be no room for any Watchers, nor conſequently ſuch whom Chriſt will then ſerve, which yet is intimated, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 37. and by ſuch Watchers this very Cry at Mid-night ſeemeth to be made; therefore All will not be aſleep, in that ſence.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The word [All] is oft-times put to ſignifie the Generality; as All <hi>Judea</hi> went out to <hi>John, Mat.</hi> 3. 5. And as thoſe walked in All God's Ordinances, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 6. and as the Goſpel went into All the Earth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 18. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In which laſt ſence, theſe Virgins (All of them) are ſaid to ſleep and ſlumber.</p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:50213:46"/>
                  <p> The Ground and Reaſon of which General ſleep may be, as unto God, That ſo the Lord might thereby Humble the Generality of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, at ſuch a Time. And thus was <hi>David</hi>'s Covenant (partly) Ordered, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 5. that none ſhould then ſeek after God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 2. as his Diſpenſation was a Type of Chriſt's, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 11. and as with reference unto Chriſt's Spiritual Kingdom, ſo with Reſpect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Temporal Redemption alſo, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 20. 44. by turning their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, who then were ſleeping, or in a Dream, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126. 1. as it is with ſinners when Chriſt firſt gives them Light, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 14. Nor can his People's Pride be more effectually prevented, than by their ſlumbring at ſuch a time; ſince by that means there is no viſible Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Wiſe and Fooliſh, and ſince they fail in the Predominant Duty of ſuch a Time, and which they have been ſo eminently fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned of by Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Mark</hi> 13. 35, 36, 37. And thus, when All have ſinned, the freeneſs of their Redemption is conſulted for, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 23, 24. or when the Deliverer of <hi>Sion</hi> ſhall turn away ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs from <hi>Jacob, Rom.</hi> 11. 26. finding them (at that time) in Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>v.</hi> 25. or Labouring under that Spirit of ſlumber which he hath therefore given them, <hi>v.</hi> 8. But as to Means, or Second Cauſes, the Reaſon of this General ſleep, is, becauſe,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt Cometh in the Night, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 10. and the Cry is made at Mid-night, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 6. As Typically of Old in <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 12. 29. which Night is thought to be no Time for work, <hi>John</hi> 9. 4. but General ſleeping, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 7. and though ſome Riſe up early, and others ſit up late, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127. 2. yet All are wont to be aſleep at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night: So that the very Seaſon is one Reaſon why this Temptation is ſo Epidemical. Now, who would have imagined (according unto com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Rules of Judging) that ſuch a Friend, a Saviour, and much more a Bridegroom, ſhould Order his Coming at ſuch a Time? Eſpecially ſince he was confidently Expected the Day before? Yea, one might be apt to think that Work or Labour, ſhould onely be expected (from Man) untill the Evening, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104 23. by vertue of God's Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that his ſleep might then be warrantable, ſince, when the Night cometh, no Man can Work, <hi>John</hi> 9. 4. 'Tis true indeed, this holdeth not in Moral Caſes, or when a Particular Exception is expreſly made; but drouzy Heads are eaſily thus made to ſleep when Satan rocks them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe of ſo many bad Examples ſet, the ſorce whereof is greater than that of Precepts, ſince theſe do onely Teach, whereas the other, <hi>(viz.</hi> Examples) Draw, eſpecially in ſinful Caſes. Moſt Men will rather go out of their way than loſe their Company; as <hi>Joaſh</hi> did (with
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50213:47"/> reference unto his evil way) ſo long as good <hi>Jehoiada</hi> Lived, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. 2. And as more do out of Chriſt's way on that Account, ſince ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarineſs doth more Afflict (the Generality) than Diſobedience. Now, here is no want of ſleepy Preſidents, with reference unto all ſorts of Virgins: and if a little Leaven be ſo dangerous, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6. much more will half Mankind <hi>(viz.</hi> the Woman) encourage the other half <hi>(viz.</hi> the Man) to follow that Example, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 6. and when All go aſtray, the Prieſts themſelves will hardly ſtay behind, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 10. 'Tis like, theſe Virgins fell not All aſleep at once, but Nodded one after another, untill the laſt was over-taken alſo, becauſe ſhe had not one Companion left to keep her waking; as poor <hi>Elijah</hi> ran for Company, when fanſying himſelf to be alone.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sleep is the Natural Effect of certain Cauſes, which Antecedents being General, the Conſequent muſt needs be ſo, according to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courſe of Nature; and this is Principally the Reaſon why this Temptation doth Generally ſo prevail (at ſuch a time) upon theſe Virgins.

Whilſt <hi>Adam</hi> was alone, his ſinleſs Nature was inclined to Sleep, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 20, 21. And much more is the Old Man ſubject thereunto, ſave as the Second <hi>Adam</hi> bids that ſleeper to awake, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 14.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50213:47"/> the ſleep of Death, ſave as his Eyes are ſo enlightened, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 13. 3, Chriſt ſets the Soul on work, who elſe is Idle, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 1. 6, 7. And ſlothfulneſs will quickly caſt one into a Deep ſleep, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 15. Now, whilſt the Bridegroom tarrieth, his quickning Influences are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held more than before they were; and if he abideth ſtill, though but two days, <hi>John</hi> 11. 6. his very Friend ſleepeth, untill he goeth to awake him, <hi>v.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe Satan is then moſt buſie, who hath the greateſt Skill (next unto God himſelf) of caſting poor Creatures into a ſlumbring Frame. He knows what is intailed upon Watchers at ſuch a time, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 37. 42. who therefore will Then be ſure to be at <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s Righthand, reſiſting him, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 1. when likely to be cloathed with Change of Raiment, and with a fair Mitre upon his Head, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5.

And if his going from them (for the Comforter) ſo fill'd their Hearts with ſorrow, <hi>John</hi> 16. 6, 7. much more the Hope of his Return, when it is deferred, will make the Heart ſick, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 12. and conſequently, the Head exceeding heavy. Many of our Virgins eyes were ditted up with dirty Tears, and they have Cryed themſelves aſleep, as Children oft-times do, when left alone in ſome dark Room, and partly from Vexation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. No Man Preciſely knoweth when he will Come, or whether ſome awakening intimations of it be not meer Deluſions, which addeth weight unto the former Heavineſs, and doth encourage ſlumberers to be ſecure.

Such onely think (at firſt) to ſlumber, but not to ſleep; or onely to ſleep a little, but hope to waken before his Coming; or that they ſhall awaken preſently, and ſoon be ready, upon ſome timely preſumed. Notice of his Coming: All which help forward this Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion while he tarrieth. Sin is Deceitful, ſtealing upon ſome (as ſleep doth) by degrees, who onely meant to ſlumber or dally with its Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Others Deſign a down-right ſleep, but onely of ſo long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, truſting that Conſcience will awaken them at ſuch an hour of the Night: But he that ſaith in his Heart, <hi>My Lord delayeth his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (the ſame <hi>Greek</hi> word that is in my Text) will take his fill of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſleep, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 48, 49. eſpecially when ſuch are furniſh'd, as theſe Virgins are, ſome of them with Oyl in Veſſels, and all with Trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Lamps, who therefore doubt not of being Ready. So that the Bridegroom's tarrying muſt needs Occaſion the Virgins ſlumbring.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 1. From the Bridegroom's tarrying we may Obſerve, the Chriſt's Affections (the ſtrongeſt of them, <hi>viz.</hi> his Conjugal Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) are abſolutely under his own Command; though he now cometh alſo to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

He is the Lord of Anger, as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> hath it, which is Tranſlated Furious, <hi>Nahum</hi> 1. 2. and doth evince it by his ſlowneſs thereunto, though great in Power, and of an Holy Nature, and much provoked by his Enemies, <hi>v.</hi> 3. He alſo loves the Diſpenſation of his Coming, which therefore is oft-times called his Bride: Yet is he not thereby Tranſported to out-run his Father's Time, though ſtrongly ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by all his Paranymphs, or Bride-maids earneſt Expectations. True Holy Zeal is no way inconſiſtent with due Sobriety, whatever ſome may Fanſy; but turbulency in Affections is one ſad ſign of their being Carnal, though fixt upon a Spiritual Object. When Tempted to be Impetuous, let us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>emember Chriſt, and that they who are his, have Crucified ſuch Affections, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 24. as is their Duty, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
                  <p>2. If all the Virgins be aſleep (at leaſt-wiſe ſlumbring) at ſuch a time, we then may hence conjecture at the Reaſon of what hath been
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50213:48"/> to be Obſerved among the Churches and Profeſſors of later Times, unto ſome Men's Amazement, ſuppoſing this Parable to have ſuch a refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> been with Sobriety ſuggeſted. Some have admired that Men pretending unto Light and Conſcience ſhould be ſo Blind, ſo wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, ſo apt to let their Duty fall, ſo little Affected with what they Underſtood, ſo Childiſh in their Reaſonings, ſo oft Relapſing into the ſame Temptation, ſo utterly unable to bear plain dealing, and ſo Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with ſome kind of Light. Whilſt others have been ſtark Deaf, affected ſtrangely with ungrounded Fanſies, unable to Reſiſt the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Adverſary, not knowing what did befal them, yea, very ſecure in greateſt Dangers, and marvellouſly affrighted with what in its ſelf hath been a Mercy. The Reaſon whereof hath been their being all aſleep, which is not ſo obvious in a Spiritual ſence, as in the Letter, elſe ſhould we not ſo much have wondred at theſe Appearances.</p>
                  <p>3. We now may ſee what little cauſe we had to be Offended with the Diſ-appointment of our ſometime Expectation, ſince Chriſt had told us of his tarrying, after the Virgins firſt going forth to meet him. Some have been therefore apt to Queſtion wholly, whether that was He, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they truſted he would have then Redeemed <hi>Iſrael</hi> altogether, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 21. But on we Fools, and flow of Heart, to believe all that the Prophets have ſpoken, <hi>v.</hi> 25. Ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered theſe things (after his being Proclaimed King) and then to enter into his Glory, <hi>v.</hi> 26? Our failing at this Day is ſadly Aggravated by that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and by Chriſt's own Prediction here (added to thoſe of Old) according to what hath come to paſs. Let us with ſhame acknowledge our former In-advertency, and not perſiſt to Queſtion the Near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching of his Name, becauſe of that, which is indeed one Promiſing Sign thereof; <hi>viz.</hi> his Tarrying beyond the Time Expected.</p>
                  <p>And ſince the Bridegroom's tarrying Occaſions ſleep, by thoſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Influences thereby Miniſtred, theſe following Conſiderations may be of ſome Preventive Uſe, by way of Counterpoiſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us Remember, that all this while we have been meerly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed with the want (or rather the Delaying) of a Priviledge, and of a Lower Nature onely. Chriſt's Spiritual Preſence (and our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with his Grace or Peace) hath not been neceſſarily denyed unto us, by Reaſon of this late Diſ-appointment: Yea, ſuch Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications might have thereby abounded, had we been Watchful in ſuch a Trying Hour, ſince in his abſence, the Comforter is promiſed to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his place, to our Advantage, <hi>John</hi> 16. 7. 'Tis not Chriſt's fault, but ours, if the Quinteſſence of Outward Liberty be not enjoyed by us in Soul-Enlargements; ſince, if the Father was to be ſeen in Chriſt, <hi>John</hi>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:50213:49"/> 14. 9. much more Chriſt's Quickning Preſence is in the Spirit, and without which his Fleſh would profit nothing, <hi>John</hi> 6. 62, 63. Now, ſhall we caſt away theſe choiſer Influences (as Sleepers do) meerly becauſe we yet have not what is of far leſs worth? What clearer Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence can there be of Childiſh Folly and Mercenarineſs in our Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, than to Deſpiſe Chriſt's Peace becauſe of Worldly Tribulations, and to deſiſt from bounden Duty for want of Preſent, or immediate Pay?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It ſeems Chriſt waiteth alſo, as this his Tarrying doth import; Expecting, till his Enemies be made his Foot-ſtool, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 13. And ſhall not we then Watch with him one Hour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 40. eſpecially when bid to do ſo, <hi>v.</hi> 38?

Thoſe are Proud Servants, who will not Help their Lord, by lifting at the Other (and Lighter) end of any Burden. Yea, he is Suffering all this while; and is it not a ſhame for his Diſciples to fall aſleep, whilſt he is ſweating, as it were, great drops of Blood, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 45? Eſpecially ſince he hath ſignified his being then at Prayer for <hi>Peter</hi> alſo, and the reſt, <hi>v.</hi> 31, 32. who formerly had continued with him in his Temptations, <hi>v.</hi> 28. but now could neither Pray for him, nor for themſelves, being faſt aſleep, <hi>v.</hi> 46.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Chriſt alſo tarrieth, for our Advantage, as hath been ſhewn: And ſhall we then ſo ill requite him, as at that very Time to Grieve him by our ſleeping? He thereby doth deſign the Actuating of our Graces; ſhall we then let thoſe Habits ſleep, as if we had a mind to croſs him? This Reſpite is vouchſafed for our Dreſſing; and ſhall we onely then improve it in putting off our Cloaths for ſleep? How ſadly did it ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate the caſe of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Eli,</hi> that they ſhould ſin juſt when God was Eſtabliſhing the one Man's Houſe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30. and the other's Kingdom, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 13. How will it vex awakened Virgins, to think how ill they have Rewarded Chriſt and their own Souls by ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering at ſuch a Time, as doubtleſsly it did King <hi>Joaſh,</hi> who ſtayed his own Hand, when God had given him leave to ſmite his Enemies untill they were conſumed, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. 18, 19. This Trying Hour is that wherein more work might have been done than all the Day before; and trifling now, may prove more Diſ-advantaging than any of theſe ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Dream of, whoſe utmoſt Diligence afterwards will not Redeem what Now is Loſt.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. There was a Typical Coming in <hi>David</hi>'s Time, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 7. in whom Chriſt came to Do and Suffer his Father's Will, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 7, 8, 9. and doth now Reign accordingly, though more inviſibly at the preſent, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 8. and with Reſpect unto his Father <hi>David</hi>'s Throne.

                  <p n="2">2. There was a Coming (afterwards) by way of Shew or Emblem,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50213:50"/> when Chriſt was Transfigured upon the Mount, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 1, 2 which ſeemeth to be that Coming in his Kingdom, which ſome there ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould not taſte of Death untill they ſaw, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 27, 28.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There alſo was a Coming in the days of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> when Chriſt did firſt Erect his Temporal Kingdom, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 5. to Recompenſe his Faithful Servants, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 17. and Execute his vengeance upon others, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 16, 17.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There will be alſo his Coming as a Thief, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 15. when <hi>Iſrael</hi> (or the Eaſtern Kings) ſhall be Converted, <hi>v.</hi> 12. to whom ſhall come the firſt (or chief Dominion that ever yet was, <hi>Mic.</hi> 4. 8. who ſhall be All Righteous, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. 21. but yet not Perfect; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that alſo will be but for a Time.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. There will be his Second Appearing at the laſt, without ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 28. which therefore muſt needs be Perſonal, or in his Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wherein he ſometimes bare the ſins of his Elect, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But then there alſo is a Precurſory Coming, which laſt is Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally intended in this Parable, as hath before been hinted.</p>
                  <p>Thus will Chriſt's Temporal Throne have ſix ſteps up into it, as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>'s had of Old, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 19.</p>

But they have put him off, with telling him, that they were all undreſt, in Bed, and ſhould defile their lately waſhen Feet, (or Dirty themſelves by outward Sufferings) by Opening to him at ſuch a Time, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 3. They were ſo far awakened, as to Hear and Parley with him: They were not abſolutely Benummed or Diſabled by Bonds or Sickneſs, but that they could have Riſen then: Nor did they deny the thing, onely the Time was not Yet come, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Is this your Kindneſs to your Friend,</hi> 2 Sam. 16. 17? But they impute it to his unſeaſonableneſs. Nor will ought but a <hi>Cry</hi> make them Ariſe; who then, perhaps, may Open to him when he is gone, and may not find him, till greater Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings have made them ſick of Love, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 6, 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>5. Midnight is a Time for <hi>Sampſon</hi> (before his Hair was cut) to Riſe and do Exploits, <hi>Judg.</hi> 16. 3. For <hi>David</hi> (or Men after God's own Heart) to Riſe, and to give thanks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 62. For <hi>Paul</hi> (a Priſoner of Jeſus Chriſt) to Pray and Sing, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 25. who (when he was at Liberty) continued his Diſcourſe till Midnight, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7. whilſt one of his ſleepy Hearers had like to have never wakened more, <hi>v.</hi> 9. This alſo hath been to be Obſerved by us, in our late Midnight. Some have been ſtrengthened (as <hi>Sampſon</hi> was) to quit themſelves of thoſe Temptations which others thought inſuperable. Some have been able (in a time of ſaddeſt Darkneſs) to give thanks (with <hi>David)</hi> at the remembrance of God's Holineſs, as is their Duty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30. 4. Some have Lift up their Voice and Sung, when there was no other Light, ſave that of God's Majeſty in the Fires, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24. 14, 15. Some alſo have thought it meet to continue their Speech (with <hi>Paul)</hi> till ſuch a time, ſo long as Liberty hath been afforded: Oh that ſuch alſo could Revive that <hi>Eutychus,</hi> who being ſleepy at ſuch a Time, hath fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſeeming ſtate of Death out of a Window (or means of Light) three Stories High.</p>
                  <p>6. Midnight is no time to look for any Notice of a Friend's or Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom's Coming, but rather for ſuch a <hi>Cry</hi> as then was made in <hi>Egypt,</hi> Exod. 12. 29, 30. And ſuch a ſurceaſe of Expectations; or ſuch a
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50213:58"/> Midnight, hath manifeſtly been upon us. The Bridegroom's near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach hath not been Credited by thoſe who formerly went out to meet him. That Witneſs hath been wholly waved, as being thought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edifying. It hath Offended ſome, when but encouraged unto a Sober hope, till Providence ſhould caſt the Scale. We have been caſt behind in ſome Men's Apprehenſions, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> in Reality was through others unbelief. Yea, Sober intimations of the Bridegroom's Coming have been (like Thieves) cryed out againſt, as being Dangerous, or tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Rob Men of Eſtate and Liberty. Thus hath a Midnight been Apparent in our Times; and ſuch a Diſpenſation is that by which the <hi>Cry</hi> is partly to be known, as having been already made.</p>

They do not ſtir, as heretofore, therefore Chriſt Calls them; they cannot ſtir untill awakened, therefore Chriſt Cryeth to them. 'Tis not an Ordinary Voice that can be heard by one aſleep; And thus Chriſt ſuits his Notice unto their Neceſſity. He might indeed have bid them now ſleep on, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 45. but their Condition Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto him, to which his Crying Notice Ecchoeth. He knoweth that the Wiſer Virgins Spirit is willing, therefore he gives them one awakening more, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 41. He knew this Cry would have ſome rouzing Efficacy; and whilſt there is any hope, he is for the uſe of means, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 8, 9.

                  <p>2. Becauſe they now are put upon the Repetition of a former Practice; which in a Caſe of this Nature needs a <hi>Cry.</hi> One may do ſomething once, in way of Frolick, which is not Seconded, becauſe it was not thought to be a Duty: And thus ſome ſerve the Lord, in way of real Humour, or apprehended Supererogation, who therefore count its expected Repetition to be unreaſonable. One may do that at firſt, which is recalled upon Second thoughts, till quickned up by freſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing Opportunity. However being wearied by their former walk, and having found that Reſt is good, they might be ſomewhat ſtiff, and loth to Riſe, unleſs ſome Louder <hi>Cry</hi> doth force them to it. Yea, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving once gone out before, they might ſuppoſe it needleſs to go forth again; ſo ſparing we are of Multiplyed pains, ſave in a way of our own chooſing, eſpecially ſince Chriſt here takes no Notice of their former

Time alſo was, when all the Virgins (at their firſt going forth) were much Encouraged from without. Their Governours began to ſay, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s <hi>Inhabitants ſhall be our ſtrength,</hi> Zech. 12. 5. they walked then from ſtrength to ſtrength, (increaſing in their Number) as they went to <hi>Sion, Pſal.</hi> 84. 7. God did then own them by his Providence, as Heathens did Confeſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126. 2. enough to make the Old Man Lively. But it hath ſince been otherwiſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a <hi>Cry</hi> is Needful.</p>

Theſe Virgins (at the firſt) did ſeem to have no want of Light, but then were fully Satisfied, as to their Preſent Work and Duty: Their Loins were girt, and their Lamps burning, which made their way exceeding plain, to what it hath been, ſince the failing of thoſe Affections by which the Judgment of moſt Men is guided. How eaſily then were all Objections Anſwered; which would not ſince have been thought ſtrong again, but that the former Light (of General Harmony) is now Eclipſed, which then was clear? Nor can it be denyed, but that the Work (at firſt) was in it ſelf more Obvious, as will appear upon the Opening of this Latter going out; In which regard, a <hi>Cry</hi> is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to clear that Eye, which hath of late been ſo dim-ſighted.</p>

                  <p>3. The Virgins (at their firſt going out) did verily Expect the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom's Coming then, as their Deſign to Meet him ſignified, who Now are bid go out again, together with an Additional Notification of his Coming: which therefore intimateth, The Re-aſſuming of their former

He taketh pleaſure in his Peoples Hope, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 11. whoſe very Expectation ſhall not Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 18. therefore he catcheth at ſinking <hi>Peter,</hi> though his firſt Confidence was not a grounded Faith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. 28, 29, 30, 31. They were now Toſſing to and fro (or Nodding) by Reaſon of the Bridegroom's Tarrying; therefore he giveth them at laſt this ſtedfaſt Anchor.</p>
                  <p>4. One's going out to Meet another, is both a Token of Reſpect, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 1. and a ſign of Longing to behold him with the firſt, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23. 15. which therefore intimateth his preſent Expectations of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from them, with reference unto himſelf.

                  <p>5. Theſe words import their going out of ſomething, in Order to their Meeting of the Bridegroom. Which things then to be gone out of, are as followeth.</p>
                  <p>1. They are to go Out of all their ſinful Deſilements of a Common Nature, which hath been their Duty alway, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. but Now is ſo by way of Eminency.

The Face of the Covering will be Deſtroyed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 7. therefore Go Out of Formality. The Lord alone will be Exalted, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 17. therefore Go Out of Slaviſh Fear and Fleſhly Confidence,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:50213:60"/> 
                     <hi>v.</hi> 22. A ſin of meer Omiſſion will ſend ſome then to Hell, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 41, 42. therefore Go Out of Negative Chriſtianity. Preachers and others will then be termed Workers of Iniquity, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22, 23. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Go Out of bare Material Duty, into its Life, and Power, and Spirituality.</p>
                  <p>2. They are to Go Out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as far as may be from the Beaſt, eſpecially from the Whore, or Antichriſt in his more Spiritual appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances. This Latter was a Duty alway, the neglect whereof was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſeverely puniſhed as Now it will be. Now, Temporal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will be entailed upon Spiritual Sins, and it is then High Time to Go Out thence, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 4. Yea, every one that is then found in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> ſhall be thruſt through, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 13. 15. therefore let none ſtand ſtill, but let <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> come into their Remembrance, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51. 50. And though the Beaſt's Name (as that of Prieſts) may falſly be continued unto ſome; yea, though ſome ſtill retain the Number of his Name, yet may both theſe eſcape that Brand of viſible Reprobates, which then will be the Portion of his Worſhippers, and ſuch as do receive his Mark; or more down-right and Manifeſt Compliers with that Intereſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 9, 10, 11. Were theſe things rightly underſtood as to their Sence and Time, enquiries of that Nature would not be though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſeful.</p>
                  <p>3. They are to Go Out of Privacy into an Open Teſtimony, as they had done before, at their firſt going forth. This alſo was an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Duty, the Neglecters whereof (in times of utmoſt Danger) are threatned by Chriſt himſelf to be Denyed by him, as being the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers of him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 27, 28. 33. Upon the firſt Riſe of the Man of Sin, the Woman then fled into the Wilderneſs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 14. as that denoted her want of former Outward Glory, but not from fear of Bloody Cruelty, (as <hi>Brightman</hi> well Obſerves upon the place) onely to ſhew, that ſuch Apoſtates did falſly call themſelves Chriſt's viſible Churches. Which alſo followeth upon the Privacy of Church-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which is a Worſhipping of the Beaſt, unto the Clouding of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors Saint-ſhip, and the deſtroying of a proper Accident, <hi>viz.</hi> Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, which is inſeparable from a Churches Eſſence: And though Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance may recover Saint-ſhip, yet ſuch a failing layeth Churches waſt, till New Erected, and which may prove to their Advantage.</p>
                  <p>4. They are to Go Out of thoſe Old Heavens, which then muſt Paſs away (at leaſt, be changed) together with the Earth of Civil Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions. This Going out of Churches is Warrantable in the fore-named caſe, yea, and a Duty; but at this time there will be no viſible Churches to continue in, although Church-ſtate may ſtill remain. Thus was it
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50213:60"/> with the Jewiſh Church, at Chriſt's firſt Coming: Thus will it be with Temple-ſtate, at his next Perſonal Coming, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 22. Yea, thus it was with preſent Conſtitutions, a little before his Coming in <hi>Conſtatine</hi>'s Time, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 13, 14. and as the ſixth Seal concluded, ſo will the ſixth Trumpet. We Now are in the Expectation of thoſe New Heavens, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 17. and then the former ſhall not be Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. Upon the Reviving of Temple-work, the Temple is ſaid to be then Founded, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 18. therefore we then muſt have New modelling. Therefore we Read of no Beaſts (or Paſtors) juſt when the Seventh Trumpet ſoundeth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 15, 16. as having lately Diſappeared ſince, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 3. untill <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 7. Now, Officers and Churches are wont to go together. Which is more plainly hinted by Chriſt's Reſolving to ſpew thoſe <hi>Laodiceans</hi> out, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 16. who were the Laſt of thoſe Typical <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches under the Dragon's or Satan's Diſpenſation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 10. 13. who muſt be laid aſide a little before the ſetting up of Chriſt's own Throne, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 21.</p>
                  <p>5. They are to Go Out of Lower Good attainments into an Higher ſtate of Evangelical Perfection. Their Childiſh things muſt now be put away, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 11. their Wheat muſt out-grow its Blade and empty Ear, <hi>

They muſt be Accurate as to the Matter of Duty; all which muſt diligently be added unto Faith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. Yea, both Obedience and Believing muſt be compleated, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Reſpect unto the Scripture as their Rule, God's Glory as their Higheſt Aim, and the Second <hi>Adam</hi>'s Spirit as their Root and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And thus as Natural Beauty conſiſts of Integrality, Symmetry, and Complexion; ſo is a Goſpel-Saint made up of Body, Soul, and Spirit; or Nature, Animality, and Spirituality: as <hi>Salem, Sion;</hi> and <hi>Millo</hi> were all United into one <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in <hi>David</hi>'s Time, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 6, 7. 9. which therefore was called a City Compact, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122. 3. and the Perfection of Beauty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 2. as <hi>Sion</hi> was a Type of Goſpel-Saints, eſpecially in <hi>David</hi>'s Time, and when he Ruleth over all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which fully Anſwereth unto the Seventh Trumpet's founding, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 15.</p>
                  <p>6. In Order unto all which before mentioned, They are to Go Out of Themſelves at ſuch a time, and every of their ſelf-concernments into a ſelf-denying frame of Spirit, elſe will they neither follow Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 24. nor yet Prepare to Meet him. <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 12.

Chriſt alſo had Honour put upon him, when <hi>Peter</hi> (at his word) did Re-aſſume that Work which had been laid aſide through former Diſappointments, <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 5. Yea, bare Going out to Meet another, doth Evidence Reſpect and Longing to behold him; both which are Signs of Honour.

                  <p>5. To ſave them from that Harm which thoſe lie open unto who keep within at ſuch a time, in Competition with this Going out.

                  <p>10. That ſo he might thus Try the Meaſure of their Strength, and Nature of their Oyl, in Order unto a plain Diſtinguiſhing between the Wiſe and Fooliſh Virgins, who hitherto were in Appearance all alike. They all went out at firſt, with Lamps and Veſſels, wherein the Special Oyl was yet an hidden thing. And while the Bridegroom tarried they did all of them ſleep and ſlumber; ſo that no viſible Difference yet ap-appeared. Yea, when the Cry is made, they All Aroſe and Trimmed their Lamps; nor do they ſeem to Differ, untill their Going out this Second time, and then they Part. This Second Tranſplantation will throughly Try the Nature of that Root, whoſe Leaves (yea, and ſome kind of Fruit) were formerly as fair as any other. This Caſting of the Corn will fully ſever it from Lighter Seed as well as Chaff; and therefore Chriſt takes this Courſe to make that Precious, wherewith he then will ſow the Earth afreſh.</p>

Nor may a former Expectation have been a meer Deluſion, ſave as <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> hath been thought (by his Diſciples) to be the Bridegroom, who onely was the Bridegroom's Friend or Harbinger, <hi>John</hi> 3. 26. 28, 29. However, let God be True, though every Man ſhould prove a Lyar, at leaſt in part miſtaken, as being the Fruit of Darkneſs and Over-haſtineſs.</p>
                  <p>2. That Diſpenſation of the Bridegroom's Coming is very Notable, or much to be Obſerved, as doth appear from Chriſt's prefixing that Word <hi>[Behold]</hi> unto his Signification of its Near approach. And if that Night was much to be Obſerved, in which God brought his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 12. 42. much more this Day, in which the Lord our Righteouſneſs will lead the Seed of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of the North to their own Land, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 6, 7, 8. That was their firſt Redemption; this will be the ſame a Second Time, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 11. Now, as Relapſes are moſt Dangerous, ſo Reſtaurations are moſt Remarkable. That was attended with following Checks and fore Temptations in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, but this will put the Gentile-Saints in full poſſeſſion of their own Land, untill the Jews Converſion. That onely was Afflicting to <hi>Egyptian</hi> Dragons, and not to any of the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> but this will ſadly fall upon the Goats, or ſlothful Servants, and Fooliſh Virgins; which therefore is much more to be Obſerved by all ſorts of Perſons.</p>
                  <p>3. When all the Virgins have done looking for the Bridegroom, then is the ſureſt ground for our concluding his Near Approach, for then doth Chriſt himſelf affirm it, which formerly had onely been preſumed. Therefore he tarrieth untill ſome kind of falſe Alarm hath made the Generality to be Secure; and then, Behold, he comes indeed. What cauſe have all to ſtand continually upon their Watch, unleſs they mean to be ſurprized by him, whoſe very Coming is not known, ſave that it will be at the moſt unlikely time. How weak are they who therefore think the Time is not ſo nigh at hand, becauſe the preſent Expectation of it is not ſo General as heretofore it may have been. This doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeak our Hearkning to that Cry, which giveth Notice of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom's
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50213:63"/> Coming when all the Virgins are faſt aſleep, at leaſt-wiſe not to count it therefore of no weight, ſince at ſome ſuch a time the trueſt ſignification that yet ever was, will then be made.</p>
                  <p>4. Chriſt here doth give ſome further Notice of his preſent Coming beſides that of his Harbinger, which ſeemeth to be more than was at his firſt Coming in the Fleſh, and which is worth our taking Notice of. He came not then to Judge the World, <hi>John</hi> 12. 47. as now he doth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 18. And ſhall a Judge ſhew more of Gentleneſs (as this Redundant warning hinteth) than did a Saviour? But though he now will Execute the Judges Office, yet doth he enter on it with a Saviours Heart: And therefore he doubly warneth Now, becauſe his preſent Work will be more Dreadful. How loth is Chriſt that any at this day ſhould Periſh, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9.! How are we more engaged to him than were the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who onely had <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s Cry: And if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſers of that ſingle Invitation were then ſhut out for ever, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 24. how can thoſe Fooliſh Virgins hope to enter, who have out-ſtood a Second Notice. Therefore this Cry had need be heeded, which elſe will doubly call for Wrath and Vengeance upon its Diſobeyers.</p>
                  <p>5. This Cry is made at Midnight, or when the Virgins are aſleep: which further ſhews the Riches of his Grace, who waiteth for the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Time wherein to make its freeneſs Evident, eſpecially ſince they had been Aakened once before, or when they firſt went out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as is evinced from their Dreaming then, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126. 1. Indeed Chriſt bad Relapſing Slumberers to ſleep on now, and take their Reſt, to ſhew what they Deſerved: But yet (to evidence the Riches of his Love) he alſo bad them to Ariſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 43. 45, 46. as here he dealeth with theſe Virgins Leſt Men ſhould boaſt of Congruous worth, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference unto the Grace of God in Chriſt, it therefore is beſtowed on them, when in the height of Incongruity or unworthineſs to receive it. Thus did Chriſt Perſonate a <hi>Macedonian,</hi> entreating <hi>Paul</hi> to come and help them, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 9, 10. Yea, thus unlovelineſs is his Time of Love, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 6. 8. who then is moved to Heal, when nothing but Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements are to be ſeen, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 17, 17. The Voice of that Cry had need be hearkned unto, which otherwiſe doth ſo abound with ſin-accen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and ſorrow-heightning Grace.</p>
                  <p>6. How ſadly are they Miſtaken who think a going Once out will ſerve the turn, which is that great Soul-ruining Mis-apprehenſion among the Virgins or Profeſſors. The World lyes ſtill in Wickedneſs, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 19. and doth not ſtir at all: But Virgins are ſuch as have gone out at firſt, and then they Reſt, who Generally periſh in that ſtate. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> firſt went out of <hi>Egypt</hi> they went out All together, <hi>Exod.</hi>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:50213:64"/> 12. 41. whoſe Carkaſſes yet Generally fell in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 29. becauſe they were not alſo free to go out Thence into Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> when called thereunto by thoſe of another Spirit, <hi>v.</hi> 24. 30. Thus alſo All the Jews went out of Nature into <hi>Moſes,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2. but not from Thence into the Righteouſneſs of God in Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3, 4. (which is Revealed from Faith in <hi>Moſes</hi> to Faith in Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 17.) and therefore they were not ſaved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 1. And thus one may have (virtually) forgotten that he was purged from his Old ſins, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 9. who having eſcaped groſſer Luſts, is not a Partaker alſo of that Divine Nature, <hi>v.</hi> 4. whoſe firſt appearance is Goſpel-Faith, <hi>v.</hi> 5. All are partakers of the Earthy <hi>Adam</hi>'s Image, but they muſt bear the Image of the Heavenly alſo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 49. or not Inherit his Heavenly Kingdom, <hi>v.</hi> 50. nor yet be ſaved, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8. ſave as they are God's Workman-ſhip Created in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>v.</hi> 10. Let us therefore (at the firſt) Go out of Ignorance into Knowledge; and then (a Second time) Out of the Form of Knowledge into Practice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 20, 21. Let us (at firſt) Go out of Diſobedience into Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and then (a Second time) out of Material Legal Duty, or the Letter, into the Newneſs of its Spirituality, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 6. Let us (a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And as to ſuch a Particular Duty and Time, peculiarly referred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in this Parable; thoſe are much miſtaken, who think a former going out will ſerve Chriſt's turn at Preſent. He ſpeaketh Now, with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto the Virgins Preſent ſtate, which intimates his Expectation of their Progreſs beyond or out of thoſe attainments, which in their Time and Place were not to be Deſpiſed. He is for Adding unto his Peoples Priviledges, <hi>John</hi> 10. 10. who therefore may expect the like from them in point of Duty, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. Nor do ſuch properly walk in any of his ways (as all the Saints are ſaid to do, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 3.) who onely take one ſtep therein, and ſo deſiſt. However, ſuch as do onely Go from the <hi>Phariſees</hi> unto <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and not from <hi>John</hi> to Chriſt, will be Inferiour unto the leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 11. if not in danger of Reverting unto the <hi>Phariſees</hi> again. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we have formerly gone out of <hi>Babylon</hi> or Old <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which Then was, we Now muſt Write that Copy over a Second time, with reference unto what is Now in Being, above what formerly hath been departed from.</p>
                  <p>And that we may thus fully follow God, in Anſwer to this <hi>Cry,</hi> theſe following Motives will be of Uſe.</p>

                  <p>2. The Way is ſafe, and more eſpecially at ſuch a Time. He Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Surely who walketh Uprightly, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 9. Since Angels are charged with him in all ſuch ways, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. 11. and a clear Call to Duty, turns Night, (yea, Midnight) into Day, or ſeeming Danger into Security, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 8, 9, 10. However, the greateſt Suffering is that of Sin, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 14. All outward Tribulations are nothing to inward Peace, <hi>John</hi> 16. 33. God's Loving Kindneſs is better than Life it ſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. 3.

And he that goeth out of Old <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (both City and Temple) at ſuch a time, may thereby ſave his Life, <hi>Jer.</hi> 21. 9.</p>
                  <p>3. The Walk is Recreating.

Then alſo was the Spirit poured out, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 4. when thoſe were all with one accord met in One place, <hi>v.</hi> 1. where all might come, <hi>v.</hi> 6. and therefore the Doors were not then ſhut for Fear, as formerly they were at Evening, <hi>John</hi> 20. 19. or when at Supper, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 14. And at this time a Spouſe may ſeek Chriſt long enough, in Bed, or in his Ancient Temple, and yet not find him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 1. nor in the City or Old <hi>Jeruſalem, v.</hi> 2. nor till ſhe hath paſſed from the Watch-men, <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4. And ſince Chriſt comes from Heaven, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 16. the Higher that we go, the ſooner we ſhall ſee him, <hi>v.</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p>5. Such onely will go with Chriſt unto the Marriage, who thus Go out to meet him, becauſe none elſe will then be ready, before the Door is ſhut, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 10. He who then hath not his Clean or Wedding-Garment on, will onely have that ſilencing check, <hi>How cameſt thou hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Mat. 22. 12? therefore go out of ſinful Defilements. This Marriage-feaſt and <hi>Babylon</hi>'s Funerals will contemporize, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 2. 9. 17, 18. therefore Go out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> for fear of being not then alive. Chriſt then will be aſhamed of Them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 33. who formerly have been aſhamed of him, or have denyed him, by letting fall their Open Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, <hi>v.</hi> 27, 38. therefore go out of ſinful Privacy. This ſame New Earth and Heavens will be laid upon the Old ones Ruines, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 17. therefore go out from hence, for fear of periſhing in that Rubbiſh. And if we look for thoſe, what manner of Perſons ſhould we be, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 14. in point of growth, <hi>v.</hi> 18. therefore go out of Lower good Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. In Order whereunto, theſe following Helps may be of Uſe ſo far as there is yet room for ſuch a Practice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Help</hi> 1. Let not your Oyl be then to Buy, which is the undoing of Fooliſh Virgins at ſuch a time: Endeavour to be ſatisfied (with all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting ſpeed) as unto what the Cry requireth; and pleaſe not your
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50213:65"/> ſelves with pleading Now, that you want Light, and therefore cannot Go. Truſt not to Trimmed Lamps, (or ſome Revived good Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;) but get Oyl into your Veſſels alſo, or in a Spiritually enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Judgment; elſe woe be to the Virgins alſo as well as others. The firſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s Legs are good at Hand, but not at length; or will not bear Men fully out this Second time. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> could go as far as <hi>John, Mat.</hi> 3. 7. but not to Chriſt himſelf, from want of Light, <hi>John</hi> 9. 29. Some may Cry up the Light and Strength of Nature as they pleaſe, but nothing ſhort of Goſpel-Grace will make Men Run and not be Weary, or not to ſaint with Walking, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 31. when Youths will fail, <hi>v.</hi> 30.</p>
                  <p>2. Let us be Searching what manner of Time the Spirit of Chriſt here ſignifieth; as did the Ancient Prophets, with reference to his firſt Coming, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11. unleſs we think the Time is come, we ſhall have no more mind to Walk (at ſuch a Midnight) than had thoſe Jews to Build, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. 2. Some may ſuppoſe the Virgins firſt going out was in the Days of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and that the Bridegroom's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here will not be till the Jews Converſion, at Chriſt's Perſonal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or <hi>John</hi>'s New <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But they who firſt went out, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fell aſleep, are they who are bid Now go out again: therefore the Firſt and Second going out cannot be ſo many hundred Years aſunder, as from the Time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> untill Chriſt's Second Coming. The Jews muſt alſo be Converted before Chriſt's Perſonal Coming, or elſe that ſudden Change then, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 51, 52. would leave no room for Mourning, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. or Building Houſes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 21. which Jews will alſo not be Converted, untill the ſixth Viol be poured out, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 12. before which time the Temporal Kingdom will be Reſtored, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 15. therefore the Bridegroom will firſt come unto the Gentiles, who will prepare the others way by drying up <hi>Euphrates, Rev.</hi> 16. 12. or caſting out the four Monarchs, <hi>Zech.</hi> 1. 21.</p>
                  <p>3. Labour to be Awakened Throughly, which is the firſt ſtep in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, and maketh way for all the reſt. Chriſt doth deſign their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus Awakened, by Calling for their Going out; and he would have them to Awake, in Order to their going on, as being both the firſt Beginner, and Means of Perfecting that Work begun. One May ſit ſtill who is Awake, but Muſt ſit ſtill, if faſt aſleep: who, till awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Throughly, will go but ſomewhat Odly and Unſteadily. And as Men would awake, ſo they muſt unfold their Hands, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 10. and Open their Eyes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 13. and draw the Curtain, or give way unto the Light, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 14. Such alſo may not be Offended with a Friendly Touch, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 7. nor with ſome Louder Noiſe, or gentle
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50213:66"/> Nip, if need requireth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 40. Such alſo muſt Ariſe, as do theſe Virgins, and not lye ſtill in ſuch a Tempting Poſture. Yea, they muſt Rub their Eyes, and ſhake themſelves, <hi>Judg.</hi> 16. 20. or Offer ſome Holy Violence unto their ſluggiſh Frame: Nay, they muſt alſo be at Work, or fall upon the Trimming of their Lamps, and entring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>4. Gird up your Loins (or Go with a good Courage, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 17.) and let your Lamps be Burning, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 35. or your Affections fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; ſo will you Open to Chriſt's Knock, <hi>v.</hi> 36. or Anſwer to hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IN this Verſe we have an Account of that which followed upon the fore-named <hi>Cry, viz.</hi> All the Virgins Ariſing thereupon, and Trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their Reſpective Lamps.

               <p>From whence the Obſervation is as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Upon the fore-named <hi>Cry,</hi> All the Remaining Virgins (both Wiſe and Fooliſh) are made to Riſe and Trim their Lamps.</p>
               <div n="1" type="question">
                  <head>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. What is the Meaning of that word, <hi>Aroſe?</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Their Riſing (upon this Account) doth intimate Their being made to Hear that <hi>Cry,</hi> in Anſwer unto which they do Ariſe. This ſignifies the <hi>Cry</hi> to have been very Loud, elſe would it not have been Heard by ſo many Perſons faſt aſleep. Now, have they not heard? Yes verily, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 18. although they have not all Obeyed, <hi>v.</hi> 16. for who hath ſo Believed our Report? That Everlaſting Goſpel, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 6, 7. doth ſeem to have been Preached before theſe Virgins fell aſleep, as alſo, that Double Notification of <hi>Babylon</hi>'s fall, <hi>v.</hi> 8. the firſt whereof was then Accompliſhed: Between which Firſt and Second Fall there is a Warning given, <hi>v.</hi> 9. which ſeemeth to be the <hi>Cry</hi> here made, and alſo to have been made already. All ſorts of Complyers with the Beaſt, and with his Mark (in Fore-heads or in Hands, that is to ſay, with reference to more Apert Commands or Covert Prohibitions) have been fore-warned, and they have Heard it.</p>
                  <p>2. Ariſing intimateth their being Now in a Capacity of Speaking, Hearing, Seeing, Weighing, and Going out, if they had pleaſed, more than before, while faſt aſleep. And have they not already been in that Capacity? Could they not have Diſcourſed what was Offered, and heard Replyes, and ſee what he that Runs might Read, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 2? Could they not have Conſidered what formerly they had not heard, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 15. before it was Condemned, <hi>John</hi> 7. 51? Yea, could they not
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50213:67"/> have walked out, as unto any viſible Rub, ſave what was of their own Creating? 'Tis true indeed, Man can do nothing of himſelf, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 28. at leaſt-wiſe not in Spiritual Caſes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. but Men forbear not upon that Account; and Common Influences might ſuffice as to the Matter (or more External Part) of ſuch a work. And in that Caſe Affected Ignorance is not Invincible, nor will Pretended inability Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 18, 19, 20. when Blind and Maimed ones ſhall be brought in, <hi>v.</hi> 21.</p>
                  <p>3. Ariſing (hereupon) doth intimate their Underſtanding and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving (in part at leaſt) what is Declared and Required by the <hi>Cry.</hi> One may be throughly wakened by that which vexeth, who then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to ſleep again: But being told, the Bridegroom Cometh, and being bid Go out to meet him, he will not Riſe, who doth not competently underſtand the Notice, and like the Motion. And hath not this alſo been to be ſeen of late among the Virgins? Have not their Swooning Expectations been Revived, as <hi>Tabitha,</hi> ſo as to ſit up a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 40? Have not ſome Heard, that Chriſt (in his Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) is both Alive and Riſen, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 23? Yea, have not ſome of Themſelves been Plauſibly convinced, becauſe his Dead Body was not to be ſeen, although they ſaw him not Alive, <hi>v.</hi> 24? Yea, have they not Approved in their Hearts and Conſciences, at leaſt, ſome part of what the <hi>Cry</hi> requireth? Which further proves its having been already made; though with ſubmiſſion.</p>
                  <p>4. Ariſing intimateth the Sleepers Moving out of his former Place and Poſture. Some Men can ſlumber as they ſtand, but yet not ſleep, till either Laid, or ſitting in ſome convenient place; both which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with Ariſing. And hath not ſuch a variation been Apparent? I mean, ſome kind of Riſing up (with Arms unfolded) from eaſier Seats and ſelf-indulging Poſtures? Some have been ſtrengthened, as <hi>Jacob</hi> was, to Riſe and Sit, though onely upon the ſame Bed ſtill, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Hearing of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Coming, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 1, 2. and his not being able to leave his Bed, was from his preſent Weakneſs, and Near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Death, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 33. Others have alſo Riſen out of their Seat, as <hi>Eglon</hi> did, upon his Hearing of a Meſſage from the Lord, <hi>Judg.</hi> 3. 20. who yet then Periſhed, <hi>v.</hi> 21. becauſe of his former evil Practices. But ſome have alſo left their Bed and Walked, as did that Damſel, upon Chriſt's ſpeaking to her, <hi>Mark</hi> 5. 41, 42. who former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had been aſleep, <hi>v.</hi> 39.</p>
                  <p>5. Ariſing upon the <hi>Cry,</hi> doth intimate their getting in a readineſs for ſome further Action, as <hi>Joſh.</hi> 8. 3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 15. and as is evident from the joyning of their Riſing, with the Trimming of their Lamps: Which leadeth to the next Enquiry.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Trimming of Lamps doth intimate (by Neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence) the taking Notice of their preſent ſtate, in point o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Oyl or Light, which could not but be then perceived, and as the Iſſue eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. While Men are faſt aſleep, (yea, till they Riſe and are at work) they know not clearly what they Have or Want, which ſhould encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage us to be upon our conſtant Watch, as we would know our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs or Miſery. Sleep doth Benight the Underſtanding, and onely fills the Head with Solacing or Frighting Dreams, for which there is no Real cauſe, as upon wakening doth appear. And have not the ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring Virgins been thus undeceived upon the freſh ſtirring of their Affections, Typified by theſe Lamps? Some have been onely Frighted into the Exerciſe of their Remaining ſtrength, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> was, upon his firſt Awakening, by a <hi>Cry, Judg.</hi> 16. 9. But others have found, that ſhaking of themſelves could do no good, no more than it did him at laſt, <hi>Judg.</hi> 16. 20, 21.</p>
                  <p>2. Trimming of Lamps doth intimate their being Cleanſed from that ſoil, which formerly hath been Contracted by length of Time, or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſnuffs, or burning too near the bottom. Lamps will contract Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution meerly through diſcontinuance of conſtant Dreſſing: And ſo will good Affections, when not conſtantly looked after, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 3. 9. 18. Much more will un-removed ſnuffs defile; or that more Groſs and Earthy part, which doth Attend our beſt Affections; Eſpecially when Lamps are ſuffered to burn too Low, or when our very Light is Carnal, which doth diſcolour our Affections, and threatens the Extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing of our Light or Judgment, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21. And have not the Virgins Lamps been All thus Trimmed? Whilſt they were ſlumbring, their former good Affections were much Eclipſed from want of Daily Rubbing, from their being onely Snuffed or Reproved by their own Back-ſlidings, and from the Degenerating of their Wiſdom into Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Policy, which ſince hath been Amended.</p>
                  <p>3. Trimming the Lamps doth intimate their being alſo newly Tipt, or Beautified with ſome freſh Adorning; the former being now decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Age and filth, and partly, by a preſent ſcouring. And have not the Virgins Lamps or good Affections been lately thus Adorned? Some could not be at Reſt untill they had put on again that Coat of Zeal for Chriſt, which formerly they had put off; till they had turned unto him, from whom they with the Generality had Revolted, in Anſwer to that Call, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31. 6. Yea, others alſo have endeavoured to ſet a fair Gloſs or Face upon their fading Lamps, or Dying good Affections,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50213:68"/> by wiſhing that it had been otherwiſe, and witneſſing unto the better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of others Practices. Thus have theſe ſought to Paint their Faces, whereas the former have Recovered their Native Luſtre; though both are in Appearance very Trim to what they ſometimes were, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others being Judges.</p>
                  <p>4. Trimming the Lamps doth intimate their making ſhew, of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fit to March, or to Go out and Meet the Bridegroom; which part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their Ariſing promiſed, much more this Super-added Preparation. And hath not ſuch a ſhew been made? Yea, have not ſome begun to March? Whom others alſo have Accompanied, ſo far as Oyl or Light hath laſted. Some have Reformed many Moral Evils of a Common Nature. Some have Repented of more groſs Compliances with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <hi>Babylon.</hi> Some are more Open (yet) in their Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but are not free to Promiſe it for the Future, nor yet to Confeſs a former failing. But moſt are ſtumbled at Going out of this Old Earth and Heavens, or Lower good Attainments, deſiring firſt to Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their Aged Parents, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 21. or Friendly to Part with them, at leaſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 61. and to fetch ſomething out of their Old Houſe, at leaſt their Cloaths, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 17, 18. not being able to go out of Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er things.</p>

                  <p>3. Becauſe this Cry Without is Seconded by Conſcience from With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which maketh room for its Reception. Conſcience is in the Soul of Man, as is the Drum within his Ear, which doth receive an Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſound, and ſo tranſmits it to the Brain, or Underſtanding, unleſs that Drum be ſpoyled, and then no Cry VVithout is Underſtood. Science alone is ineffectual, but Conſcience is knowing Together with, or Co-atteſting unto the Truth and VVeight of what is Offered by another. Now, that which is here Notified by the <hi>Cry,</hi> is readily Ecchoed unto by awakened Conſciences, which do Remember, Chriſt May be Coming, and then it is a Duty to Go out and Meet him. And when a <hi>Cry</hi> without is Anſwered by a <hi>Cry</hi> within, the deepeſt ſleeper muſt needs awaken, and do ſomething, untill the Ear be Deaſned, and Conſcience ſome way ſatisfied, ſo as to ceaſe its Bawling Noiſe.</p>
                  <p>4. Becauſe the Perſons cryed unto are Virgins or Profeſſors, and ſo more eaſie to be awakened than others are. Theſe were not Dead, but onely faſt aſleep, who therefore were more likely to Rouzed up, at leaſt-wiſe by ſome Louder Call. Profeſſors are Deſcribed alſo by their Nearneſs unto Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 17. which is a great advantage, in point of Hearing, above what others have. The <hi>Cry</hi> is alſo more Particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Directed to the Virgins here, which promiſeth a ſuitable Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 19, 20, 21. and in which Caſe, a <hi>Jehu</hi> will ariſe, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9. 5, 6. And though Proud <hi>Pharaoh</hi> Knew not God, upon his Hearing of a Meſſage from him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. 1, 2. Yet none of theſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins are ſo Atheiſtical, as to Reject what ſeems to be Divine. And though ſome former Profeſſors may have made away their Conſcience, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 19. Yet Virgins (whilſt Remaining ſuch) have ſomething of a Tender Spirit in them, which doth Oblige their Hearkening there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                  <p>5. The Wiſer Virgins might be concluded light of Hearing, and of an Obedient Diſpoſition, with whom the Fooliſh Yet were in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; and if but one of a Company be awakened, he may awaken all the reſt. Spouſes are never ſo faſt aſleep, but they both Hear and Know the Voice of their Beloved, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 2. Chriſt's Sheep are to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50213:69"/> be known by ſuch an Ear-mark, <hi>John</hi> 10. 3. who thereupon do alſo follow him, <hi>v.</hi> 4. And <hi>Philip</hi> being Called, will call <hi>Nathanael, John</hi> 1. 43. 45. Yea, frighted Mariners will not let <hi>Jonah</hi> ſleep, <hi>Jonah</hi> 1. 5, 6. if in their Company. This is the benefit of Fellowſhip with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Saints, though Labouring under ſtrong Temptations; what is it then to be in Communion with the Watchful? And though no Oyl could be afforded by the Wiſer Virgins, yet might the Fooliſh be thus awakened, who otherwiſe, perhaps, had not been much Affected with the <hi>Cry,</hi> ſave as ſome of their own Companions did enliven it by their Example, which are more Prevalent with ſome than Precepts.</p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4. Why do the Fooliſh Virgins (alſo) Riſe and Trim their Lamps, who had no Oyl to lead them further, as had the Wiſe?</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Theſe being at the preſent wakened, muſt needs do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, who ſcarcely could do leſs than Riſe and Trim their Lamps. They were awakened by the <hi>Cry,</hi> whether they would or no; and to lye ſtill with Open Eyes, or to Riſe up and to be altogether Idle, would onely make their Conſciences Rage the more, till it be made to ſleep again. Thus are ſome Hurried in that, which as they never Thought to have Begun, ſo neither do they mean to Proſecute it, ſave till ſome fair Occaſion be afforded of Quarrelling therewith, and of Returning into their Former ſtate. This is the Fruit of Injudicious good Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Raſh Engagements, whereof Men ſoon Repent, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 30. and which are eaſily deſiſted from, without much inward real conflict, <hi>Ruth</hi> 4. 4, 5, 6. Truſt not unto the Force of Natural Conſcience, no more than to the haſty ſpringing up of Seed in Stony Ground, which hath no Root, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>2. They poſſibly might not Yet perceive their want of Oyl, untill their Lamps were Trimmed, Labouring ſtill under that Miſtake, which made them at the firſt to venture out, through ſleightineſs and ſelf-conceit. They who ſeek not to un-deceive themſelves in Time, may juſtly be given up to ſtrong Deluſions, that they ſhall verily believe a Lye; and they who ſleep with Empty Veſſels, will ſcarcely Dream of ought but Fulneſs; nor yet awake (in Spiritual Caſes) with any other (Timely) apprehenſions. When Souls fall once in Love with Naked good Affections, they ſeldom prize a Spiritually enlightned Judgment, untill it be too late to Rectifie that Fundamental and Soul-damning-Error. It is with Spiritual Pride, as with a Tympany, which (being Chronical) is hardly Cured, eſpecially in Caſe of a Relapſe, or when a Soul hath formerly been warned of it, as all the Virgins or Profeſſors were, when firſt enlightned.</p>
                  <p>3. They fain would go as far as might be with the Wiſer Virgins,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50213:69"/> with whom they firſt went out, and having ſlept together, they ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly endeavoured to Ariſe and Trim their Lamps, in Anſwer to the <hi>Cry,</hi> as do the other: Great is the ſingle Force of Pre-engagement, and as with reference unto ſin, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 25. ſo with Reſpect unto ſome kind of good, <hi>John</hi> 19. 22. Yea, <hi>Jephthah</hi> (rather than he would go back) choſe to Deny himſelf in Sacrificing his onely Child, <hi>Judg.</hi> 11. 35. Pride alſo is Predominant in Fooliſh Virgins, who therefore may do more than otherwiſe they would have done, becauſe they ſcorn to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind their Fellows. Communion alſo begetteth Love; and Love con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained <hi>Ruth</hi> (who yet had not a better Principle) to keep her Mother Company, <hi>Ruth</hi> 1. 15, 16. Yea, Natural Conſcience will Regret, to Part with Ancient Precious Friends, when barely put upon Repeating their Joint former Practice, untill ſome more than Ordinary Let doth intervene, and till a plauſible pretence or colour ſhall be Offered for ſuch a Parting.</p>
                  <p>4. They might do This without any Prejudice to Themſelves; and in that Caſe, ſome eaſier work will not be ſtuck at by a Fooliſh Virgin. 'Tis nothing (in Compariſon) for one Awakened to Ariſe: Nor can the Trimming of One's Lamp (or ſtirring of ſome good Affections) much Diſquiet any Man whoſe Principal Intereſt, or Corruption is yet untouch'd. Thus Satan is content to Gratifie the ſinner's bawling or a wakened Conſcience, by giving him a Diſpenſation to Hear, and Read, and Pray ſometimes, untill that Crying fit be over. Nor is a Worldly Intereſt endangered by what this Trimming of the Lamps im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, no more than <hi>Nicodemus</hi> his Coming unto Chriſt (by Night) did him; ſince he was yet within the Compaſs of that Law, <hi>John</hi> 9. 22. And though an Harlot will not do thus much, yet is the moſt Fooliſh Virgin Wiſer than to diſtaſt a Boſom Friend, by Grudging that which may be ſafely granted.</p>
                  <p>5. They might think (being Fooliſh) this was All; untill the <hi>Cry</hi> is, as it were, Expounded by the Wiſer Virgins Going further: So prone are Hypocrites to Magnifie their own Performances. Or they might think this would ſuffice at leaſt; either to carry them out, as at the firſt, or to Excuſe them, in Caſe they did not Go, having thus ſhewn their good Affection by Trimming of their Lamps.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, they might think their Trimmed Lamps would be ſufficient to carry them out this Second time, as well as at the Firſt, when they did onely take their Lamps, but no Oyl with them; not minding the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that Now was, both as to the Work it ſelf, and alſo the ſtrength of their Affections. The Work it ſelf was Then more Eaſie, and their Affections were more Lively, than at the Preſent: But when
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50213:70"/> poor <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Hair was cut, he ſtill was apt to Fancy that ſhaking of himſelf would ſerve the turn, as heretofore at other times, <hi>Judg.</hi> 16. 19, 20. This truſting unto fore-Experiences is many times the Ruine of unſound Profeſſors, who Argue from a former Practice, unto their Future perſeverance, and ſo betray themſelves into the Tempter's hand through their Preſumptuous Confidence. <hi>David</hi> indeed might ſafely Argue his following Succeſs from what he formerly had met with, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 37. becauſe he went in the Name (or Strength) of God, <hi>v.</hi> 45. which Hypocrites do not pretend unto; and therefore, ſince their Good is not in their Own Hand, <hi>Job</hi> 21. 16. it is no wonder if their Lamp or Candle be put out, <hi>v.</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they might (at leaſt) ſuppoſe, This would Excuſe them, in Caſe they went no further; having thus ſhewn their Willing Mind, or good Affections, by Trimming of their Lamps. Thus ſome poor Creatures are apt to Fanſy, that good Deſires will ſerve the turn, who therefore plead a Love for Chriſt, ſuch as thoſe Virgins had, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 3. who yet were not Eſpouſed to him. Theſe Good Affections are the Bane of Hypocrites, who think to Borrow upon Practice, by their Preſenting Chriſt with good Deſires; but he will not be Mocked. Onely themſelves are fully ſatisfied, if they have but a liking of Chriſt's ways, a Love for Walkers in them; eſpecially if they are Up and Doing, to the Height of their pretended Light. Indeed Chriſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times doth Accept a Willing Mind, but that Relateth onely to Invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Inability, and not to Fooliſh Virgins, but the Wiſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 11, 12. both which are ſadly mis-applyed by them to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>6. This Work is of a ſelf-paying Nature, as well as ſafe: and <hi>Ephraim</hi> (that ſilly Creature, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7. 11.) is willing to Tread out the Corn, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10. 11. or Work and Eat together, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 4. ſo is a Fooliſh Virgin. The firſt Going out was attended with preſent Pay, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Fooliſh Virgins therefore Joyned; ſo is their Second Riſing and Trimming of their Lamps, though not their Second Going forth: And Carnal Jews will follow Chriſt whilſt they are filled with his Loaves, <hi>John</hi> 6. 26. who Walked no more with him, <hi>v.</hi> 66. when nothing but Spiritual (or inviſible) Bread and Fleſh is promiſed to them, <hi>v.</hi> 51. But Riſing doth Refreſh the Conſcience much, ſo doth the finifying of Affections: Since it is Natural unto Maids or Virgins to think more on their Ornaments than on their Reſt. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 32. Yea, they would not elſe be accounted Virgins; the Preſervation of which Name or Title doth Plentifully Recompenſe the Fooliſh Virgins preſent Labour, who therefore are thus at Work.</p>
                  <p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. As none were to be counted Virgins Heretofore, ſave
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50213:70"/> they who at the firſt went forth to meet the Bridegroom; ſo when the <hi>Cry</hi> is made, none are to be Accounted Virgins Then, ſave they who thereupon Aroſe and Trimmed their Lamps; ſince All the Virgins (at ſuch a time) are ſaid to do ſo. And ſo long onely doth the Warrant of Communion laſt with ſuch, and of their being Owned as Profeſſors; who Differed from the Wiſe at firſt, as to Reality; but from This time they ceaſe to have the Name of Virgins given to them, and as that Name is Common to the Fooliſh with the Wiſe, in point of Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. This ſhews the ſadneſs of their viſible State, who are not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with the <hi>Cry,</hi> ſince they have thereby forfeited the Name of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins; in Chriſt's Account, as having ſlept the ſleep of Death. Yea, they who are not Parted Now from ſuch as Theſe, will not themſelves be counted Virgins.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Here we may ſee one ſad Effect of ſleep or ſlumber, <hi>viz.</hi> the marring of our Lamps at leaſt, as their being Trimmed (by awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened ones) evinceth. Now, Virgins uſually are very Neat; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this conſideration might ſuffice to keep ſuch ever waking, as they would not ſpoyl their Trimming. How Glorious was their firſt Love, when ſhining with a Lively Exerciſe thereof, and Burning with an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Zeal for Chriſt at their firſt Going out, together wherewith their Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry alſo hath been loſt. Man's Eye is eminently the Seat of Beauty, which therefore needs muſt be Eclipſed, together with the Cloſing of his Eye with ſleep, which is Death's Image. In point of viſibility, Darkneſs it ſelf is ſtaining, <hi>Job</hi> 3. 5. and ſleep will Ruffle the fineſt Ornaments in Reality; therefore none would be ſeen in their Night-Habits, nor will they lye down to ſlumber, till they have either put off their Bravery, or ceaſed to be ſtudious about its Preſervation.</p>
                  <p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Hence we may Learn, how far the Wiſer and Fooliſh Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins may go together. They All went out at firſt, they All were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with a ſlumbring Spirit; and now they All Awaken, Riſe, and Trim their Lamps together. It is a Mercy to be Awakened, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are ſo, to their ſhame, who either ſleep again, or onely Muſe and Talk a little, and to leſs purpoſe, if that be all. It is ſome further Mercy to be Raiſed up, which yet an Hypocrite may be Intereſted in, who may not onely Hear Chriſt's Voice, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 26: and be in a Capacity of doing more, but alſo may Approve what is more Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 18. Yea, Fooliſh <hi>Galatians</hi> may Begin to Run, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 3. and 5. 7.

               <div n="1" type="question">
                  <head>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. What is that ſence of wanting Oyl, which doth here ſeem to be in Fooliſh Virgins, with reference unto themſelves?</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is a ſence at Laſt, but not in Time, <hi>viz.</hi> not in Due Time. They ſhould have lookt to this at firſt, but were too Haſty then, having enough to ſerve their preſent turn, and not deſiring to have more, till meer Neceſſity doth enforce it. And thus, when Fleſh and Body are conſumed, a Fooliſh Man may mourn at Laſt, and be convinced of his wanting Wiſdom, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5, 11, 12. Thus did the light of Hell's Fire (at Laſt) make <hi>Dives</hi> ſee his want of Care, which he himſellf Deſpaired to Redeem, onely would have his Brethren to be warned by him, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 27, 28. Yea, thus poor Living <hi>Eſau</hi> did perceive at Laſt, how Fooliſhly his Birth-right had been Sold by him, when it was now too late to gain the Bleſſing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 16, 17. 'Tis not the depth of Sence, ſave as it alſo is in Time, which can Advantage late enlightned ones, or make it out, that ſuch Impreſſions are any other, but what a Natural Man may have and periſh with. Untimely ſelf-ſowing and appearing Corn is Ploughed up, becauſe it is not ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable.</p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:50213:71"/>
                  <p> 2. There may be (in ſuch) a ſenſe of want, but not of any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or ſelf-worth, Relating to this Special Oyl. A Natural Man may be in Love with Grace's Portion, but doth not ſee the Native Beauty of her Perſon, abſtracted from the other. Theſe Fooliſh Virgins ſaw they could not Go without the Wiſer Virgins Oyl, elſe would they not have Mourned in its Abſence, till Intereſt did ſhew it to be Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. Whereas a Gracious Soul would have A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>l Grace at Preſent, and conſequently ſome whereof there is no preſent Need; ſuch as is Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Grace in times of Peace; and ſuch a Degree of any Grace which is not Abſolutely Neceſſary to Salvation. This ſenſe of worth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in theſe Wiſer Virgins, who took Oyl with them at the firſt, although that preſent Expedition might have been made without it.</p>
                  <p>3. It is a Paſſive ſenſe, or from a Forreign Evidence, rather than from an Active ſelf-enquiry. They did not ſearch their Veſſels, as they ſhould have done, untill their Lamps were Going out, which did Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate the Preſent taking Notice of their wanting Oyl, elſe had they ſtill been Ignorant. Thus one may Accidentally be Made to ſee, what otherwiſe he would not have Enquired after, no more than <hi>Ahab</hi> did <hi>Elijah</hi> or <hi>Micajah,</hi> if he could fairly have avoided them. Spiritual Convictions are croſs to Fleſh and Blood, which <hi>Felix</hi> had no time to hear, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 25. which <hi>Pilate</hi> ran away from, <hi>John</hi> 18. 38. and <hi>Balaam</hi> would have ſhunned if he could: Yea, ſome Profeſſors ſtand in need of being urged unto ſelf-examination, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. which yet a Gracious Heart is Active in, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 40. but very few others. And though an Hypocrite may Go exceeding far, yet Generally he is no Voluntier in ſuch a Service, ſave as that Young Man's ſelf-conceit made him ask Chriſt, <hi>What lack I yet,</hi> Mat. 19. 20?</p>
                  <p>4. It is a ſenſe of Conſequents, but not of a Procuring Cauſe. They ſaw into the Emptineſs of their Veſſels, but not their wretched Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, who elſe might have Prevented this before. 'Tis rare to find a Cordial ſelf-condemning Hypocrite, with reference to ſelf-contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a Moral Nature, who yet are deeply ſenſible of wanting Care in other Caſes. <hi>Cain</hi> was ſenſible of his Puniſhment, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 13. and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> (in that Reſpect) of ſin, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10. 16. and others alſo of their wanting Grace, but not of being Acceſſary thereunto, through wretched ſleightineſs. Such either lay that Cauſe at Satan's Door, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 13. or falſly charge it upon God, <hi>James</hi> 1. 13. or elſe Tranſlate it unto others, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 24. but ſin is a Brat diſowned by its Natural Mother, ſave where Grace alſo is. Whereas an Holy Heart is chiefly ſenſible of his being Active unto (or an Occaſion of) that want of Oyl,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50213:72"/> which otherwiſe could be more eaſily endured by him, if it were onely in a way of Suffering, and not of ſin.</p>
                  <p>5. It is a Natural ſence, but no way Spiritual. Grace is not Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually to be diſcerned in its Total Abſence, as it now was with Theſe, who took No Oyl with them, and ſo could not be Spiritually Affected towards it; elſe might one Exerciſe Grace before he hath it. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n may know what is in him, yet with reſpect unto the things of God, that knowledge is nothing which is not from his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: And ſo the deepeſt Natural ſence is Spiritual Non-ſence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11. Whereas a Gracious Soul ſees what he hath or wanteth, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of an Heavenly Beam, Comparing Spiritual things with Spiritual, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 13. So that (in ſuch) a ſence of Abſence is both more clear and leſs Afflicting, becauſe it Argueth ſome kind of Preſence. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions iſſuing from Natural Conſcience, are either Flaſhy or Enraging: But Heavenly and Spiritual Light is to be known, as by the plainneſs of its Demonſtration, <hi>John</hi> 16. 8. So by the Dueneſs of that Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which doth Accompany the deepeſt ſenſibleneſs Occaſioned by it, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 3. 6. Compared with <hi>Judas</hi> his Conviction, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 3. 5.</p>
                  <p>6. It is a ſence of wanting Oyl in Lamps, but not in Veſſels; the Latter whereof is of far greater Conſequence, as is a ſound Mind (or Honeſt Heart) Compared with the beſt Affections. Thus were the <hi>Phariſees</hi> Apprehenſive of ſome Leſſer failings, but not more Weighty Matters, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 23. as ſome are ſenſible of Actual ſins, but not Original; or of their wanting ſuch Particular Fruits, but not the Root of a Renewed Principle.

But if an Hypocrite may have ſome Preſent ſtirring of Affections in him, his Conſcience is ſo weak, as to be ſatisfied without a Change of Mind, or Spirit of Grace, which is the onely Conſervator and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobler of good Affections. This is the utmoſt of that ſence, (Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the want of Oyl) which may be in a Fooliſh Virgin, or unſound Profeſſor.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It muſt be onely in a way of Counterfeit, or of Pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the want of Preſent Light, becauſe they had no mind to Walk, as was exhorted unto by the <hi>Cry.</hi> Thus one of thoſe Invited Gheſts made ſhew, as if he Could not Come, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 20. whoſe want of Will was all the Cauſe, elſe might his Wiſe have come with him, and both
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50213:72"/> of them ſhould have been Welcome. Indeed good <hi>David</hi> once did feign himſelf bereſt of Reaſon, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 13. and <hi>Peter</hi> made as if he knew not Jeſus, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 27. but neither of them did perſiſt herein, as do theſe Fooliſh Virgins. And thus, as ſome are willingly Ignorant, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 5. ſo others ſcorn to be Accounted Blind, <hi>John</hi> 9. 40. who yet will ſeem as if they did not ſee that which is Manifeſt in their Conſcience, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. and want not Light, but onely Grace to uſe that Talent, the Hiding whereof will not excuſe from being caſt into that outer Darkneſs, where they ſhall weep in vain, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 30.</p>
                  <p>2. They here Confeſs a Weighty Failure without Affection ſuitable thereunto. The want of Oyl (at ſuch a time) is of the ſaddeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, yet do not we read of their Lamenting, but onely ſaying <hi>Our Lamps are Gone, or Going out.</hi> Man is endued with Affections, which (ſince the Fall) are Diſlocated or Miſ-placed, as to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Objects. An Hypocrite is never Moderate ſave with Reſpect to Spiritual Loſſes, which he can ſignifie without Complaining. Thus ſome confeſs their want of Light, whoſe Gummed Eyes are not ſo much as waſht with Natural Tears. Affections are both the Outward Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and ſtirrers up of Inward Senſe; which they who Bridle now, when need requireth ſuch a vent, will Weep the more hereafter, unto the multiplying of their fruitleſs ſorrow. Unſound Profeſſors may be Affectionate, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 16. but unaffectionate Confeſſions (in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous Caſes) have ſmall appearance of their being ſound, but like the Fooliſh Virgins.</p>
                  <p>3. Much Partiality may be Obſerved in their Confeſſion.</p>
                  <p>1. They confeſs their Want, or Suffering onely, but not their ſin, or want of Care to be ſupplyed at the firſt. Moſt Bodily Sickneſſes are from Intemperance, yet few Complains of the one, are truly ſenſible of the other; much leſs will they Confeſs it, ſave in a Caſe of Groſs Exorbitancy. The bare acknowledgment of one's Suffering transfers the Cauſe upon another; but the confeſſing of its in bred-Root doth add Diſgrace unto the Plaintiff's ſorrow. Thus ſome bewail their want of Spiritual ſtrength, as being an heavy Portion from the Lord; but take no notice of their ſluggiſhneſs, as being Acceſſary to their own en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebling. And it is eaſier to be Convinced of a ſin, than to Confeſs it, as <hi>David</hi> found, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 3. and much more <hi>Saul,</hi> till he was forced thereunto, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 30. Indeed 'tis Folly to complain of Puniſhment, and not of Sin, which is the Cauſe, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 39. but yet 'tis very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and more eſpecially to Fooliſh Virgins.</p>
                  <p>2. They do Confeſs the Preſent Failing of their Oyl, but not their taking No Oyl with them at the firſt, as Chriſt had truly ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50213:73"/> them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 3. They would be thought to have had that, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ch now they do confeſs was Gone, or Going. How weak are they, who ground the Fallible Nature of Holy Oyl, upon theſe Fooliſh Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins falſe Pretenſion; as if They were to be believed more than Chriſt. But thus an Hypocrite would ſave the Reputation of his former ſtate, when forced from his preſent Claim. What Paint do ſuch beſtow upon Profeſſed Tombs, by ſeeking to Embalm that which they do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be Dead. But thus, a wrong Foundation is not owned, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the failing of a Superſtructure; and though ſome leſs miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage may be confeſſed, yet is ſelf-honour (in an Higher caſe) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted for, in ſuch Profeſſors deepeſt ſelf-condemnations, as was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent in <hi>Saul</hi>'s Example, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 30.</p>
                  <p>3. They onely do Confeſs the Failing of their Lamps, and meerly with Reſpect unto this preſent Expedition: But not ſo <hi>Plainly,</hi> their want of Oyl; at leaſt-wiſe, not their having (Now) No Grace at all. All have their Failings, ſaith an Hypocrite, and I have mine: making no Difference (in point of kind) between himſelf and others, but onely in Degree. <hi>Agur</hi> confeſſeth himſelf to be Beneath a Man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 2. and <hi>David</hi> himſelf, to be <hi>Behemoth,</hi> or a Beaſt of the Plural Number, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 22. whilſt Hypocrites will call themſelves of the Holy City, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48. 2. the Seed of <hi>Abraham, John</hi> 8. 33. the Temple of the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 4. Thus ſome confeſs their want of Light into a Duty urged unto; but Judge that Ignorance to be conſiſtent with the Main, and are offended with the Queſtioning of their Spiritual ſtate, meerly becauſe that Oyl is wanting. It would be well if All were thus Ingenuous: But <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> would rather Dye, than make a full and free Confeſſion; and of this Nature is that Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment which is here made by Fooliſh Virgins.</p>
                  <p>4. They do not Deny this Going out to be the Wiſer Virgins Duty; yet will they not confeſs their own ſitting ſtill to be their ſin; but Judge their want of Oyl or Light, ſufficiently to Vindicate them from that Charge. A Gracious Heart is ſenſible of unknown Errors, and doth deſire to be cleanſed from ſecret faults, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 12. not counting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be therefore Juſtified, ſimply, becauſe he knoweth Nothing by himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. but Fooliſh Virgins are not Careful (at leaſt, not ſelf-condemning) in ſuch a caſe. It ſatisfieth ſuch, if they can ſay, We have no Light into ſome-kind of Practice; the total Neglect whereof is therefore not Accounted ſin, till they ſhall come to be Convinced. Particular Actings of this Nature may ſometimes be in Wiſer Virgins; but yet this is the Principle of Fooliſh ones, which therefore ſhould be
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50213:73"/> Cautelouſly Pleaded by us in any caſe whatever. But this may need to be further cleared up, in a Queſtion by it ſelf.</p>

Yea, who may therefore charge his ſinleſs Angels with ſome kind of Folly, <hi>Job</hi> 4. 18. becauſe of their Ignorance compared with his Infinite Omniſciency. And if Man juſtly may impute the Father's ſin unto his Innocent Child, much more may God impute the firſt Man's Diſobedience unto others, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19. whoſe Ignorance (in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect) was Abſolutely Invincible. And into which Reaſon, <hi>(viz.</hi> the Soveraignty of his Will,) the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall is Ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately to be reſolved, together with the Hiding of his Mind from others. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 25. becauſe it ſeemeth good to him, <hi>v.</hi> 26. This is enough to ſilence the Subtileſt Diſputant, who elſe might be too hard for his Opponent, as to the Equity of God's finding fault, at leaſt-wiſe in ſome Caſes, or with Reſpect unto Man's being Hardened by the Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 18, 19, 20.</p>
                  <p>2. Pretended or Willing Ignorance is ſo far from Excuſing any one, as that it ſadly Aggravateth a Neglect of Duty. If ſome were truly Blind, they would Comparatively have no ſin, <hi>John</hi> 9. 41. but either Themſelves diſdain to be ſo called, <hi>v.</hi> 40. or elſe it is Apparent other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, that either they do falſly Pretend unto the want of Knowledge, <hi>John</hi> 7. 27, 28. or that (at leaſt) they Might Know if they Would, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 5. This kind of Ignorance is of a Lying Nature, <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 3. which is not Expiated, but by a deeper Humiliation, or Greater Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7. for any Soul or Perſon, <hi>v.</hi> 2. than if his Ignorance were Real, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 27. This ſeemeth to be the Caſe of all theſe Fooliſh Virgins, or ſome of them, at leaſt, who would think ſcorn to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſhallow; yea, who preſumptuouſly Neglect thoſe Means of Light which are afforded to them, and thereby are in danger of being cut off, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 30, 31. and Now by God himſelf, who hath the Preſent Execution of ſuch Laws, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 28. 31.</p>
                  <p>3. Invincible Ignorance may be ſufficient to Excuſe from Actual ſin; but not when Means of Light are Miniſtred, though not Convincingly underſtood. Original ſin (as all confeſs) is chargeable upon Infants, whoſe Ignorance is yet invincible: But Actual ſin is not imputed, ſave with Reſpect unto a Law Proclaimed, which alſo may be underſtood. Thus Heathens who are Ignorant Invincibly of Goſpel-Laws, ſhall
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50213:74"/> not be Judged, ſave by the Law of Nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 19. or that which is written in their Hearts and Conſciences, <hi>v.</hi> 15. But Perſons Living under the Goſpel's ſound, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 18. ſhall be Condemned by that poſitive Law, <hi>v.</hi> 1. though not ſubmitting thereunto, by Reaſon of ſome kind of Ignorance, <hi>v.</hi> 3. Therefore the Diſpenſation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is oft-times called a Kingdom, becauſe they who Live under it, are Equally (for kind) Obliged to take Notice of its Laws; which alſo Might be underſtood, were they but careful in the uſe of Means.</p>
                  <p>4. One may be at the preſent Guilty of a ſin, <hi>Lev.</hi> 4. 13. who yet is not Obliged to Confeſs it, (or offer a Particular Sacrifice for it) untill he is Convinced of it, <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>Lev.</hi> 5. 4, 5, 6. ſave onely in a General way, or from an eaſie ſuppoſition of its being Poſſible, <hi>Ezek</hi> 45. 20. One may confeſs a Real ſin, who yet may therein Lye againſt himſelf, unleſs he alſo is Convinced of it; therefore Conviction muſt g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yet is that Perſon Guilty before the Lord, and conſequently bound from Peremptory ſelf-acquitting, though not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to make a Poſitive Acknowledgment. Such therefore ought to Grant that in the Notion, which they are not yet bound to charge upon themſelves, as to a known Particular Application. Yea, ſuch ought alſo to be ſelf ſuſpitious, and to confeſs the Poſſibility of their failing, though none ſhould urge them to any more than barely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>5. One may Tranſgreſs at Preſent, in his Not Doing ſuch a thing, who yet is not immediately engaged Now unto the Practice of it, till he ſhall be enlightned thereinto. Though an Erroneous Conſcience doth not Affirmatively bind me unto ſin, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 9. 15. yet doth it Negatively bind from Duty, untill that Duty is cleared up, and yet my preſent Non-performance of it may be ſinful. God will be firſt Served with the Head (or Knowledge) in every Sacrifice, <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. 8. and would have every Man to be Perſwaded in his own Mind, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 5. elſe Real Duty may Rationally (or unto ſuch a Man) be ſin, <hi>v.</hi> 23. Yet his Not Doing of it (from Erroneous Doubting) is alſo ſinful; becauſe that Ignorance is ſelf-contracted, where Means afforded are not convincing. Self-blinding Men are not firſt bound to ſee, but to anoint their Eyes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 18. Yet their Not Acting from want of Sight, is to be charged on them as a ſin whilſt they are Blind.</p>
                  <p>6. One's ſelf Contracted (Real) Ignorance, may ſomewhat leſſen both Guilt and Suffering, but doth not Take them quite away.

They do not ſay, Help us to ſuch a Meaſure of this Oyl, as you ſeem to be furniſhed with; much leſs do they Deſire to have their Veſſels filled with it; but onely, <hi>Give us [Of] your Oyl;</hi> as if ſome Leſſer quantity would ſerve their turn. An Hypocrite may crave ſome Part of Grace, or juſt ſo much as Conſcience and Occaſion doth require, who yet is loath to bear the whole, for fear of being too much burthened. Thus ſome would have Reſtraining Grace, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. 34. and Saving Grace at laſt, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23. 10. Others are for the Higheſt Notions of Spiritual Knowledge, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 1.

This Argueth that Water is not Elementary, ſave unto Fiſhes; ſince other Creatures when moſt athirſt, are yet afraid of being Drown'd in its Abundance.</p>
                  <p>2. It is not a Deſire of Oyl (at all) in Veſſels, but onely to ſupply their Fading Lamps, as the ſubjoyned Reaſon of their Deſiring it doth Evidence. An Hypocrite is moſt ſollicitous about his Lamps or good Affections, which if he can but competently keep from Going out, the Deadneſs or Extinction of his Principle and Judgment is not the Matter of his Lamentation. Such moſtly are Delighted in that kind of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which worketh moſt upon Affections, how ever dark the Mind is left; yea, poſſibly Miſ-guided, by Reaſon of a Zeal for God, but not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto Knowledge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 2. This is too Natural unto the Beſt, ſo far as Folly is remaining in them; but is Predominant in Fooliſh Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, who altogether are deprived of Heavenly Wiſdom. But yet theſe wiſer Virgins took Oyl in their Veſſels; nor are ſuch ſatisfied with others
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50213:75"/> Oyl in that Reſpect, as theſe poor Fooliſh Virgins would have been; but are for being taught by their Anoynting, and not by any Man whatever, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 27.</p>
                  <p>3. It is a Deſire of Oyl from Man, (or from the Wiſer Virgins) but not from Jeſus Chriſt. Means are not to be Dis-regarded; but yet, if any Man lack Oyl or Wiſdom, he is firſt bid to Ask of God, <hi>James</hi> 1. 5. as <hi>Solomon</hi> did, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1. 10. but ſo did not theſe Fooliſh Virgins. An Hypocrite will not Delight himſelf in God, <hi>Job</hi> 27. 10. A Common Jew will firſt ſpend all upon Phyſitians, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 43. and Carnal Hearts content themſelves with Applications made to Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. How few add Prayer unto their Hearing, ſave in a Formal way of doing both; and thence it is they are no more Advantaged by either. Whereas a Gracious Heart doth know Chriſt onely hath the Key of <hi>David, Rev.</hi> 3. 7. both as to the Speakers Utterance, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 3. and Hearers Entrance, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 14. therefore ſuch chiefly ſue to him. And if a Man may Hypocritically Deſire Light of God, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. 19. much more of Man, who is leſs Dreaded, and who cannot detect his cloſe Diſſimulation.</p>
                  <p>4. It is not Properly a Deſire, but rather a Demand, made up of much appearing Pride and Diſcontent; as thoſe words <hi>[Give us]</hi> do import. <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Servant could Humbly ſay unto a Virgin, <hi>Give me [I pray thee] a little Water,</hi> Gen. 24. 43. But <hi>Iſrael</hi> (in a way of Chiding) ſaid to <hi>Moſes, Give us Water, that we may Drink,</hi> Exod. 17. 2. So do theſe Fooliſh Virgins ſpeak unto the Wiſe, as <hi>Jacob</hi> bad <hi>Laban</hi> to Give him his Wife; not in a way of Supplication, but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Gen.</hi> 29. 21. <hi>Give me thy Son,</hi> ſaid he unto that Woman, in a way of Courteſie, not to himſelf, but her, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 19. So ſay theſe to the Wiſe, elſe they muſt Part, as if Continuance with them were a kindneſs to the Wiſe. Yea, theſe bid, <hi>Give us of your Oyl,</hi> as <hi>Iſrael</hi> (Atheiſtically) ſaid to <hi>Moſes, Give us Fleſh,</hi> Numb. 11. 13. which was not in his Power to do; no More than Man can give Light to another. Thus is an Hypocrite's Deſire made up of Pride and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, inſtead of Vertue, Grace, or Common Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>5. It is a Lazy Deſire this of having Light freely Given, without any ſtore of Coſt or Pains. We may not Sell the Truth, but yet are bid to Buy it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 23. And as with our Laborious Searching for it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 4. ſo by our Chearful Suffering the Loſs of all for that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling Knowledge, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. But Man (as Man) knows not the Price of Oyl or Spiritual Wiſdom, <hi>Job.</hi> 28. 13. Nor will an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite Give ought for Truth, at leaſt not hazard the Loſs of All, as doth an Heavenly Merchant for this Pearl, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 45, 46. An Hypocrite
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:50213:75"/> is free to Hear what may be underſtood by one that's half aſleep, and could do ſomething, if he might not Suffer; but otherwiſe he plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Poverty and Weakneſs of Capacity in this Caſe, though not in other Matters of Equal Difficulty and Expence. If Light be darted in upon them, or if they might but ſave their Money, ſome would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of <hi>Given</hi> Oyl, who elſe will neither Buy nor Walk, till forced to it; and not then neither, ſave onely in a way of outward ſhew.</p>
                  <p>6. It is a cold Deſire this, not uttered with any ſign of Earneſtneſs, as <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. nor Seconded with Importunity, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 23. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the other did not plainly ſay, <hi>Not ſo,</hi> (which words are added by our Tranſlators;) nor do they Abſolutely gain-ſay the Motion made, but onely bid them [rather] go to them that Sell, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 9. <hi>Paul</hi> Thrice beſought the Lord for Grace untill he had it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8, 9. and <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid unto the Angel, <hi>I will not let thee Go, except thou Bleſs me,</hi> Gen. 32. 26.

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 5. How came the Fooliſh Virgins Lamps (or good Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) to go out, before their Work was done?</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Becauſe they were not fed with Oyl out of their Veſſels, or from a well-informed Judgment. 'Tis ſaid, they took No Oyl at firſt; and then, Not in their Veſſels, to be ſure: Therefore their Lamps could not be Laſting. Life in Affections onely is but like unto Sap re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding in a Branch, which being ſevered from its Root, may ſprout a little (eſpecially if thruſt into ſome Moiſter Ground) but in a ſhort time will come to nothing. Indeed there is a Gradual Difference (in point of Laſtingneſs) between ſome Natural Mens Affections, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with others, as is between their Bodily Conſtitutions; but though ſome may Live longer, yet all are Mortal, ſave as they are Preſerved and Animated by an Immortal Soul or Judgment; and Violence of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe doth onely ſhorten their continuance. As we would therefore have our Lamps not to go out, ſo let us take heed of Empty Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</p>
                  <p>2. Becauſe the very Lamps of Fooliſh Virgins (or their Affections, as in Themſelves conſidered) are much Inferiour to the other's in point
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50213:76"/> of Laſtingneſs. Saints are compared to Green <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſſions are of no long continuance. Yea, Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites Affections are like thoſe Lamps or Candles, which have ſome ſwailing Thief in them, or ſome Particular Object fixt upon, which (as a Sucker) makes the Branch to wither: whereas a Good Man guideth his Affections with Diſcretion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. 5. which therefore laſt the longer. Thus we may Learn, both why the Fooliſh Virgins Lamps go out, and how we may ſecure our own, <hi>viz.</hi> by getting our Affections Sanctified.</p>
                  <p>3. Becauſe the very Oyl wherewith the Fooliſh Virgins Lamps are fed, is alſo differing from the others in point of Fatneſs, Purity and ſelf-multiplying; all which are Influential to its Laſtingneſs. The Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Virgins Oyl was onely Common at the beſt; and Nature's Oyl (compared with that of Grace) doth quickly ſpend it ſelf, and upon thoſe fore-mentioned Accounts, as may be thus made out.</p>
                  <p>1. Spiritual things are alſo Fat, and conſequently not ſo apt to waſt. Such is the Moiſture of the Olive-Tree, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9. 9. eſpecially of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 17. and of thoſe Bleſſings obtained through Faith on him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 2. and through Communion with him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. 8. and 63. 5. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 14. Therefore Affections fed with ſuch like Conſiderations are of a more laſting Nature; and thence it is that True Believers are not ſo ſubject to Back-ſlide, becauſe their Motives to continue ſtill are of a more Lively and Eternal make, <hi>John</hi> 6. 67, 68. But choiſeſt Earthly Delicates, in point of Moral Nouriſhing, are very Lean, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 15. which leave the Earer's ſtomach alway Craving, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 29, 30. therefore Affections fed therewith, are apt to ſaint upon their being diſcontinued; and he that onely Drinketh of ſuch Water will Thirſt again, <hi>John</hi> 4. 13, Yea, Lower things are no way ſatisfying, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 2. while they continue, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 1. 8. and Increaſe, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5. 10. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Souls Acting upon that Account (in ways of Duty) are at the beſt uncertain, compared with others, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 23. and 14. 14.</p>
                  <p>2. That which is Spiritual, is alſo Pure, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 12. and Pureſt Oyl (at leaſt-wiſe in a My<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tical ſence) will burn the longeſt time; therefore that Sacred Lamp which was to be alway burning, was Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be fed with pure Oyl-Olive beaten, <hi>Exod.</hi> 27. 20. Now, a Divine Command is Pure, <hi>Pſal</hi> 19. 8. ſo is that Wiſdom from above,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50213:76"/> 
                     <hi>James</hi> 3. 17. yea, ſo is a Believers Hope of Future Glory, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 3. therefore Affections fed with ſuch like Arguments, are of a long continuance. Since God's Command endures for ever, ſo doth his Duty whoſe Outward Peace gives place to Purity, and whoſe very Hope is of a Soul-purifying Nature. But Earthly Lower Motives are Compounded, as is the Matter whereof ſome Lights are made, which therefore quickly ſpend themſelves with ſpitting, and leave a Noiſome Snuff behind them. Therefore the Fooliſh Virgins Lamps go out, with an Offenſive ſmell unto the Wiſe, who thenceforth cannot bear to have Communion with them any longer, but wiſh them alſo to be Gone, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 9.</p>
                  <p>3. That which is Spiritual, is of a ſelf-multiplying Nature alſo, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Wiſer Virgins Oyl is like that of the Widows, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4 3, 4. and that which Multiplyeth in its pouring out, muſt needs be Laſting. Inherent Grace is (partly) therefore Everlaſting, becauſe it is alway Growing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92. 12. 14. ſo is a Suffering Saints future Glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. and Preſent Conſolations, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 5. yea, his Faith alſo, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 3, 4. therefore Affections fed with ſuch a kind of Oyl, are as a well watered Tree, whoſe Fruit and Leaf continue in a Time of Heat and Drought, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 7, 8. But Lower things are of a Paſſing Nature, 1 <hi>John.</hi> 2. 16, 17. uncertain at the beſt, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17. and at the laſt will come to Nothing, <hi>v.</hi> 7. yea, Periſh with the Uſing, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 22. therefore Affections ſed therewith muſt needs be of a fading Nature; eſpecially ſince Lower Motives are apt in time to Deaden Men's Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections unto Spiritual Objects: whereas that which is Spiritual, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Preſerver and Embalmer of that Affection, which is thereby maintained.</p>
                  <p>The Truth of all which may yet more fully be made out, by taking a Particular Notice of thoſe Motives (or that Oyl) wherewith the Lamps or good Affections of unſound Profeſſors unto Duty, are main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. All which are Fading. As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When Duty is Affected for its Novelty, which may not be ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily perceived at the firſt, as afterwards. <hi>Athenians</hi> ſpent their time in nothing elſe but telling and hearing ſome New thing, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 21. who therefore had ſome Affection for <hi>Paul</hi>'s New Doctrine, <hi>v.</hi> 19. which afterwards was Mocked by them, <hi>v.</hi> 32. Thus did the Jews Affect <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s Light, though onely for a Seaſon, <hi>John</hi> 5. 35. or during its Prime and Flower, as <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is derived, ſignifying Beautiful, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15. becauſe a thing in Seaſon is ſo, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 3. 11. And upon this Account the Fooliſh Virgins might Go out at firſt; but therefore were their Lamps or good Affections ſoon Extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50213:77"/> Whereas a Gracious Heart Affects the Nature of his Duty, who therefore ſtores up All, both New and Old, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 52. and Loves it to the End, as Chriſt doth him, <hi>John</hi> 13. 1. But he that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth a Woman for her Beauty, is oft a Widdower before his Wive's Deceaſe; and upon that Account poor Fooliſh Virgins are ſoon Divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from that Duty, which was Eſpouſed onely for its Beauty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When Duty is undertaken from a Paſſionate Pang, or ſtrong Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe upon their Spirits thereunto, which doth petray ſome into Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and maketh all to faint in ways of Truth. Impulſes are uncertain things, which therefore never can beget a fixed Frame; as in thoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Prophets, whoſe ſtrange and ſudden Variations from themſelves did thence ariſe. Impulſes are ſuſpitious things, eſpecially ſince the Perfecting of a ſurer Rule: And when a Call is not Exceeding Clear, Danger will repreſent it as a meer Temptation, unto the Failing of ones Real Duty. Impulſes alſo are oft-times Contradicting; and Intereſt in that Caſe, will have a Caſting Voice, as being alway Next to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and in its ſilence evermore ſupreme. Whereas a Goſpel-Saint is Taught to Heed that Written Word, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. which is both certain, ſafe, and ſelf-agreeing: Therefore his Duty (Built upon that Rock) will ſtand, when other Bottoms fall together with their Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When ſuch a Path is Walked in, not for the way it ſelf, but for the ſake of One's Companions, in point of Quality, Reſpect, or Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; it being Natural to have Men's Perſons in Admiration, <hi>Jude</hi> 16. And thus a Ruler's Faith, or Practice of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> is by ſome Men Accounted the ſtrongeſt Argument, <hi>John</hi> 7. 48. Others will Serve that God who is the God of their Reſpected Friend, <hi>Ruth</hi> 1. 16. Others will be concluded by the Generality of Profeſſors, right or wrong, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 18. But as few Men of Rank are Called, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 26. So fewer of them will continue Faithful in a Trying hour, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 5. and Love unto One's ſelf will hazard a Parting with Deareſt Friends in times of Danger, <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 50. and as the Generality are never Right, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 14. ſo few are free to Die for Company, or Perſevere in Duty upon that Account, whatever they Profeſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 35. Whereas the Righteous holdeth on his way, <hi>Job</hi> 17. 9. as doth a Traveller upon ſome earneſt Buſineſs, though all forſake him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When Duty is Affected (Mainly) for it's ſuitableneſs to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Reaſon. Reaſon is good, as is the Law, if uſed Lawfully, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 8. elſe Duty needs muſt be imperfect in point of Laſtingneſs, as well as Form and Matter. Right Reaſon (as the firſt) did ſhew the Equity of Man's Obedience to the whole of his Creator's Will, as it
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50213:77"/> was Then ſignified, or might be afterwards; but Reaſon is much Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by the Fall, as is the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. ſave as fallen Man is under it to Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 21. Faith is the proper Form of Goſpel-Duty, which therefore (as in the <hi>Greek)</hi> is called the Obedience of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 5. and therefore Duty bottomed upon Reaſon, muſt needs be apt to Putrifie, as is Man's Body when ſevered from his Soul, or its Subſtantial Form. Natural Reaſon doth Oppoſe ſome part of that Material Duty which is required, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 21, 22, 23. therefore that Rational or Legal Man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could not go on unto Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, <hi>v.</hi> 21, 22. Whereas a Goſpel-Saint ſees that by Faith alone, which might have been known by Reaſon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 3. who therefore ſeeth alſo that which Reaſon never would have Evidenced, <hi>viz.</hi> the Duty of his Loſing all, in ways of Proper Goſpel-Duty, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 26. <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 12, 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 24, 25, 26.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When Duty is performed in the ſtrength of Reſolutions, or meer Natural Courage, which are a Means and Mercy not to be Deſpiſed, but yet not to be Truſted in, as <hi>Peter</hi>'s inſtance ſadly ſheweth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 35. 74. Courage may carry through a Natural Undertaking, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 12, 13. and Vows of Old were of Religious Force, <hi>Judg.</hi> 11. 39. but other Armour is preſcribed in Goſpel-times, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 10, 11. Chriſt having choſen what is Weak, that ſo no Fleſh ſhould Glory in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 27. 29. Courage is under the Command of Reaſon, and when the Captain Runs, (as Reaſon will, in Spiritual Caſes) the ſtouteſt of his Souldiers cannot ſtand, for lack of Conduct: And Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions are depending upon Courage, which therefore needs muſt Run together with it. Whereas a Gracious Heart is not ſo much for ſaying what he will do, as Labouring to ſet Duty home upon his Heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44. 20, 21. and waiting upon God for Light and Strength, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 4, 5. Oppoſing Faith to Natural Fear, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56. 3. who therefore is not Moved, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 8. and 62. 2.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. When Duty is affected in a time of Safety, and upon that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Birds hatched in a Summers Seaſon are Generally Gone (at leaſt-wiſe will not ſing) in Winter: Whereas thoſe Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were moſt Faithful, who were Converted in a Time of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Men walking in the Fields for Recreation, are driven back by an appearing ſtorm: but therefore ſuch will neither Sow nor Reap, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11. 4. Peace is a Mercy, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 31. to be Prayed for, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. but he that is not an hardy Souldier, will never be a Faithful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 3. Therefore a Gracious Heart is not for Lingring till the ſtorm be over, becauſe he longeth to be Maſter of that great Temptation. Yea, therefore God inureth His unto ſome kind of daily
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:50213:78"/> Tryals, leſt (being over-tender) they ſhould give back upon a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den change.

The Luſt of the Fleſh, (or Worldly Pleaſures) and the Luſt of the Eyes (or Worldly Riches) do ſeem both of them (Generally) to be preferr'd before the Pride of Life, or Worldly Honour, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 16. to ſhew the Weakneſs of this Latter Motive, compared with the other Two, though All of them are Worldly, and conſequently of a Paſſing Nature, <hi>v.</hi> 17.

                  <p>2. Thoſe are not worthy to be called Virgins, who are Condemned by theſe Fooliſh Virgins Carriage to the Wiſe, in ſuch a Caſe and Time. Theſe do not call the other Deſperate, Schiſmatical, or ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceited, for Offering to go out without their Company: <hi>Eliab</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was an Invidious Fellow, who neither would Engage (himſelf) with that <hi>Goliath,</hi> nor yet let <hi>David</hi> go without a Cenſure, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 28. Theſe do not call their Darkneſs Light, nor boaſt of their New Trimmed Lamps, but do Confeſs their going out: <hi>Saul</hi> therefore was exceeding Impudent, who did aſſert his having been Obedient, againſt both Senſe and Conſcience, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 13, 14. Theſe do not ſcorn to be Inſtructed, nor Totally Neglect the uſe of Means, but freely come unto the Wiſe, to be partakers of their Oyl: Therefore proud <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah</hi> was near his End, who ſcorned to be Taught by his Inferiour, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25. 15, 16. So were <hi>Eliab</hi>'s Sons, who cauſeleſly Railed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Moſes,</hi> but ſcorned to come up unto him, to have the Caſe Decided in a Friendly way, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 12, 13, 14. 32.</p>
                  <p>3. The Fooliſh Virgins Lamps are alway apt to fade, and will at laſt Go out, eſpecially at ſuch a Time, or when the Cry is made.

                  <p>This is a Failure of High Concernment, which I ſhall therefore a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſhew the Symptoms of. And ſo the Symptoms of Decaying good Affections (or Fading Lamps) are briefly theſe.</p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:50213:79"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Sympt.</hi> 1. When onely in an hour of Temptation there ſeems to be a want of Light into that Truth or Duty, which formerly (and in cool Blood) was never Doubted of. If <hi>Peter</hi> knows not Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 72. nor <hi>Nabal,</hi> who Famous <hi>David</hi> is, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 10. nor <hi>Iſrael,</hi> what's become of <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 32. 1. It is not ſo much from Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as want of Love. That Lamp (and not its Oyl) is to be blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whoſe Light is alway clear, untill ſome Nip or Guſt of Wind doth put it out: and in that Caſe Men wrongfully complain of Darkneſs. 'Tis true, Back-ſliders never were Judicious; and yet their not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in the Truth, is nextly cauſed by the failing of their Affections, and is a ſign thereof. A Real Friend doth Love (a Thing or Perſon) alway, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 17. therefore Adverſity will make no Alteration, ſo long as Friendſhip doth continue, however injudicious that Affection is. And let no Man deceive himſelf, his Turning aſide from Chriſt cannot be from a Better Light, but want of Love.</p>
                  <p>2. When every ſmall Occaſion is improved by Profeſſors, whereon to fall, or be Offended. Love covereth a Real Sin, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 12. and Charity beliveth all things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 7. eſpecially when there is Ground for Confidence (as in this Caſe there is) that ſuch a Thing or Perſon is not Culpable, when moſt ſuſpected. But when the Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Virgins Motion (for Oyl or Light) is ſoon Denied, eſpecially when <hi>Haman</hi>'s ſuing for his Life is moſt unreaſonably miſconſtrued, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 7. 8. Yea, when a Man is therefore called an Enemy, for telling that which cannot be denyed to be a Truth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 16. Such Mens Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections certainly are Altered. Well might they be Concluded to be Envious or Diſ-affected, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 18. who could not ſay, what Evil Chriſt had done, and yet Cryed out to have him Crucified, <hi>v.</hi> 23. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he that doth Love his Maſter, will not Accept of Freedom Offered, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 5. Nor will <hi>Ruth</hi> leave her dearly Beloved Mother, although ſhe hath a fair Occaſion Miniſtred, <hi>Ruth</hi> 1. 15, 16. nor will ought ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate a True Believer from his Love of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 35.</p>
                  <p>3. When Means afforded for Satisfaction (as to the Truth of ſuch a Duty) are very ſleightly attended unto, if at all. He daily Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateth in the Law of God, who dearly Loveth it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 97. and he that Cordially deſireth Heavenly Wiſdom will ſeparate himſelf (from other Buſineſs) to ſeek it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 1. Nor is a Love-ſick Spouſe Diſcouraged (by what ſhe meeteth with) from the Purſuance of her Beloved, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 6, 7, 8. But Dilatory Hearers, who feigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are for a more Convenient Seaſon, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 25. and ſuch as put a Queſtion, but ſtay not for its Anſwer, <hi>John</hi> 18. 38. eſpecially they who will not ſo much as come unto the Light, <hi>John</hi> 3. 20. Yea, they
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50213:80"/> who Perfunctorily converſe about Enquiries of this Nature, or do not Hear in Hearing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 13. do plainly evidence their want of Love unto the Truth, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 10. Thus ſome are eaſily convicted of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying good Affections, becauſe the ſtrenuouſneſs of their Endeavour doth no way ſuit the ſhew of their Deſire.</p>
                  <p>4. When Ordinary Light is not ſufficient, without ſome more than Neceſſary Demonſtration; which yet in other like Caſes is by ſuch Perſons thought to be unreaſonably expected by another. God made Man upright, or Plain-hearted, but he hath found out many bad In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions or Evaſions, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7. 29. and out of his own Mouth ſhall he be Judged, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 22. Some things of Old were Darkly hiated, much more in Goſpel-times, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 4. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 34. to Try Men's Ingenuity, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 15, 16. or who are of that Choſen Number, that will Obey as ſoon as they ſhall Hear, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 44. Love made the Spouſe (when half aſleep) to Hear the Voice of her Beloved, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 2.

                  <p>8. When that Reproach which ſome Men caſt upon the ways of God, is Lightly born by thoſe who do Profeſs to walk therein. How would the VViſer Virgins have been Moved, in caſe the Fooliſh had Reviled them, becauſe of Going forth.

                  <p>9. When Souls are Satisfied with Ignoble and Dull Performances of that Duty which God requireth. Love ſcorns to be affrighted into Duty, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 18. or baſely to be Hired thereunto, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 17. yet will it Act unto its utmoſt, as that which <hi>David</hi> did with good Affection, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 3. he alſo did with all his Might, <hi>v.</hi> 2.

                  <p>10. VVhen Souls are not Affected duly with anothers Duty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Themſelves are not ſo properly concerned.

But others onely Cry that Duty up wherein Themſelves are Eminently Engaged: But this is ſelf-Love, and not a Proper Love of Duty. Love is commenſurated by its Object, therefore Chriſt doth not call that Love or Friendſhip which is not both Indefinite, <hi>John</hi> 14. 15. and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, <hi>John</hi> 15. 14. forbidding his Diſciples to fault that Good which others did who walked not with them, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 38, 39. <hi>Moſes</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, that all the Lords People were as he, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 29. and others ſtedfaſtneſs was that by which <hi>Paul</hi> was Preſerved alive, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 8.

                  <p>9. If our Affections be not fixed upon Chriſt, they will then faſten
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:50213:83"/> otherwhere unto our Diſ-advantage. One may have Power over his own Will, in point of Marriage, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 37. who yet muſt needs Affect ſomething or other; and if not Chriſt then either Sin or Creature-comforts will have all. <hi>Incline my Heart unto thy Law,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) and not to Covetouſneſs,</hi> Pſal. 119. 36. <hi>q. d.</hi> if Thou doſt not ſecure me for thy ſelf, then <hi>Mammon</hi> will be ſure to have me. Affections cannot keep their Virgin-ſtate, but will Eſpouſe ſome Early Object: And when Souls are not alway Raviſh'd with Chriſt's Love, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent will creep in upon them. Yea, if ought elſe be Maſter of our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, God will be Hated by us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 24. there being no Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle kind of Abnegation (on either part) between him and the Creature, as is between one Creature and another. Therefore let us Affect Chriſt and our Duty, elſe will it not be long before we Hate them both.</p>
                  <p>10. God's Love unto his People doth provoke their ſuitable Return, elſe will they be Inferiour unto Publicans, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 46. and Sinners, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 32. He Loved them firſt, which doth prevent Upbraiding, but calls for after-love, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 19. His Love to them ſurpaſſeth Knowledge, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 19. and ſhall their Love to him not be made known at all, or very little? He Loves them with an Everlaſting Love, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 3. And did a ſtream yet ever fail (without a wonder) whoſe Spring continued? No Man hath Greater Love from any, than have the Saints from Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 15. 13. and are they not then unworthy of him, in caſe they Love ought More than him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 37?

Nothing can ſeparate them from the Love of God in Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 39. who then ſhall ſeperate Chriſt from their Love of him, <hi>v.</hi> 35, 37, 38?</p>
                  <p>11. Love is the greateſt Factor, and many times with very little Charge, which ſhould Encourage us to keep it up (for Chriſt) with ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt care. A good Man ſets his Love upon the Lord, therefore God Promiſeth to Deliver him, becauſe he thereby ſeems to know his Name, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. 14. whereas bare want of Love (to Chriſt) incurrs the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Excommunication, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 22. Yea, <hi>David</hi>'s Love was am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Recompenſed, when it was onely in his Heart to Build an Houſe for God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 11. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 3. therefore the Pooreſt Saint ſhall be Rewarded for their Benevolence, which ſome could never Evidence, ſave by their good Affection, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 34, 35. And if Saints ſhall be dealt with by the Lord, according to then Love, their Portion then muſt needs be Endleſs, for ſuch hath been their good Affection, however
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:50213:83"/> ſhort their Actions be. Yea, therefore both Their Happineſs and others Miſery will be Eternal, or Anſwerable to their Endleſs Love.</p>
                  <p>12. Saints do Profeſs much Love for Chriſt, Soul-love, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 7. and their being Sick thereof, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 5. yea, their being alway ready to break with an Indefinite Longing after his Judgments or their Duty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 20. If <hi>Peter</hi>'s Queſtion were put by Chriſt to any here, <hi>John</hi> 21. 15. their Anſwer would be like his, as to the Truth (if not the Meaſure) of their Affection; and would be Grieved (as he was, <hi>v.</hi> 17.) if their Profeſſion of that Nature be not Credited; yea, all the People would ſay Amen unto that Curſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 22. as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did of Old unto thoſe Comminations, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 26. Therefore theſe Fooliſh Virgins would be thought to have ſo much Affection ſtill, as to Deſire more; or rather they onely meant the want of Light, (and not of Love,) by this Confeſſion of Lamps going out. <hi>O therefore Love the Lord, al ye his Saints,</hi> Pſal, 31. 23. and do not onely make a ſhew thereof, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>13. There can be no true inward Peace or Satisfaction ſo long as there is a Reſtraint upon Affection towards Chriſt and Duty. As Anguiſh ſhut up is ſtrangling, <hi>Job.</hi> 7. 11. ſo is a Gracious Heart in Pain while its Affections are unduly ſtopt, in point of Godly ſorrow, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 3.

Yea, a good Conſcience (if Awakened) is not at quiet, nor doth enjoy it ſelf with Comfort ſo long as its Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for Chriſt are Dead; and therefore <hi>David</hi> Prays for being Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in God's way, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 37. according to his Word, <hi>v.</hi> 25. and for his Names ſake, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143. 11. ſo would he call upon him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80. 18.

                  <p>14. The Going out of Lamps (or Failing of our Affections) is one ſad Sign of Fooliſh Virgins, and more eſpecially at ſuch a time, or in theſe latter Days.

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:50213:84"/> 
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 20. 22. therefore the ſhedding of this Flower exceeds the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of that Fruit, in point of Spiritual Diſcrimination. The Cooling of Profeſſors Love is ſaid to be the Predominant Diſtemper of ſuch a Time, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 12. and Time-Temptations are dreadful Symptoms. Thus are the Wiſe and Fooliſh Virgins (here) Diſtinguiſhed: And Typical <hi>Epheſus</hi> is Threatned with un-churching (and conſequently, with being viſibly un-Sainted) for leaving her firſt Love, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>15. Extinguiſhed Lamps (in ſuch a Day as this) will hardly be ever Lighted more untill the Door be ſhut. The Nearer that any Union is (as that of Brethren) the Greater is its Diviſion upon a Breach, and ſo much the more Hard is its being re-united, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 19. And as Affections are Enobled by their Objects, ſo love for Chriſt Degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into ſleightineſs, doth therefore enter into the Depth of Putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as Beſt things do, when fallen into Decay, which conſequently are moſt irrecoverable. Thence is it, that ſo few Adulterers (or Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliders) do Return, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 19. ſo Boiſterous is that Affection which is not kept within the bounds, of its allowed Object. And Time-Temptations (ſuch as this is at preſent) are more eſpecially Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or Incurable, becauſe they are a Spiritual Plague or Token of God's Diſpleaſure, by which his Own are ſeparated from the World, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12. 7. Therefore let our Affections be well Guarded Now, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we mean to have thoſe Lamps put out for ever.</p>

                  <p> And as we would keep our Affections up for Chriſt and Duty, theſe following Helps may be of Uſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us ſtand Gazing upon theſe Objects, as thoſe Apoſtles did, when Chriſt Aſcended, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 10. nor ſhall we need to fear our being therefore checked, as they were then, <hi>v.</hi> 11. becauſe their ſtedfaſt looking Terminated upon his Fleſh, unto our Admonition. As is the Sight, ſo is Impreſſion; Beholding Changeth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion doth Aſſimilate, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 2. Yea, <hi>Job</hi> concluded the working of his Friends Affections towards him, in caſe they would but look upon him, <hi>Job</hi> 6. 28. as looking upon Chriſt doth make his Piercers mourn, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. with Supplication. Therefore <hi>Job</hi> made a Covenant with his Eyes, <hi>Job</hi> 31. 1. and Drunkards are bid to take heed of look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Wine, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 31. Yea, when Chriſt would not be Overcome, he bids the Spouſe to Turn away from him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 5. So Powerful is Sight upon Affection. And if Ten Thouſand Objects were in View, Chriſt would appear to be the chiefeſt of them all, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 10.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us endeavour alſo to Trim ſuch Objects, ſince our Affections unto Things and Perſons are much Inflamed by the Bravery of their Adorning, as Harlots too well know, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 33. Nor doth Chriſt need to be ſet out by us, ſave as an Eye of Faith can Dreſs him with his Own, or rather ſee him as he is, or as he (at the leaſt) will at the laſt appear in Glory. Men therefore Hide their Faces from him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 3. becauſe his Viſage is firſt marred by them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 14. ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſtripping him of his ſtately Robes, or by diſcolouring them with their Evil Eye. Could we but look at Jeſus, as he is Now ſet upon his Father's Throne, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. how ſhould we Run with Patience the Race that is ſet before us, <hi>v.</hi> 1. Since Duty hath the ſame Deben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur's, and which as ſurely will be diſcharged. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 12. Yea, how would Duty at the Preſent Raviſh, could we but Eye its Native Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, our being therein moſt like to Chriſt, together with that Peace which doth attend it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If any One Duty would be alway loved by us, ſo let our Love be Univerſal, and let us not Deſpiſe the leaſt; at leaſt-wiſe not the Greater Branches of it, ſuch as Time-Duties are by way of Eminency. He that Deſpiſeth any of his ways, ſhall Die, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 16. his Love thereunto will Decay; it being with Obedience, as with a Faggot, the ſmalleſt of whoſe ſticks (when plucked out) doth looſen all the reſt. A Killing Cold is oft-times got (in tender Bodies) by leaving off a Thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Garment; yea, by not having it cloſely Girt about us. Much more if Weightier Matters are Diſ-eſteemed; it being with our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50213:85"/> as with a Civil State, which ſoon will come to Nought, when Babes and Children are in Chief Command, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3. 4. Time-Truths are as the Bond of Duty, which being once ſlackned, doth hazard the Diſſolution of our Love in General, as both Experience and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Witneſs; and without Love to which no True or Laſting Love to any other can ſafely be concluded otherways.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let our Affections unto Chriſt be Genuine, or Kindly, and not Enforced. One may be Over-awed to Love another, but Souldiers Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

We ſhould Love God with all our Heart and Soul, and Mind, and ſo with all our Strength, <hi>Mark</hi> 12. 30. elſe as an injudicious love is alway Carnal, (though fixt upon a Spiritual Object,) ſo it will never laſt; and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Exerciſe doth onely Poſt a Mortal Body ſo much the faſter into its Grave.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Let our Affections unto Duty be kept up in their conſtant Exerciſe, as we would have them to continue. That Lamp which is not always Burning, will go out. If (in this caſe) we ceaſe to Love, Affection will ſoon Die, as doth Man's Body without continual Breathing; Loves Breath and Life is in the Noſtrils of its Exerciſes. He that would row
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50213:85"/> againſt the Stream, (as every of Chriſt's Lovers doth) muſt have a Care of Miſſing any one ſtroak, for fear of being Turned quite away. This ſome have found to be the Iſſue of Religious Intermiſſions, under pretence of waiting for the Spirit, till Love unto that Duty hath been quite Extinguiſhed. And as indulged ſluggiſhneſs is one Symptom of our Dying Love, ſo is it a Cauſe thereof; as ſtirring up this Heavenly fire (by a Lively Excerciſe) is likelieſt to prevent its Going out. When we have once Raiſed the Bell of Duty, a ſteady pull may keep it up with eaſe, which elſe will Fall, and may not Riſe again.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Let us not Hanker after other things. Sin Killeth our Affections quite, and if the Creature hath too much, Chriſt will have none at all, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 15. A right up burning Lamp will laſt the longeſt; but when its Light doth waſte on either ſide, it ſwaileth much, and hazards an Extinction. Chriſt ſitteth light, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 30. but <hi>Mammon</hi> (got up behind him) Tireth us, in ways of Duty. Could we but lay aſide theſe heavy Weights, how ſhould we Run with Patience the Race that is ſet before us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1? How can ſome wonder at the Cooling of their ſcattered Love! It being therewith as with Sun-beams, which are not burning, ſave as they are United, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86. 11. We cannot Approve our ſelves to God, unleſs we ſtudy, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 15. and ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is inconſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This favouring ſo much what is of Man, (though onely in a way of Longing for them) deſtroys our Taſte of better things, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 23. and our Deſires thereof.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Let our Affections (unto Chriſt and Duty) be of the Nobleſt Kind, both as to their Riſe and Maintenance. Chriſt may be Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Carnal Arms, and in that caſe, the Ivy (about an Oak) may wither ſoon, becauſe its Root is of a Weak Decaying Nature. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors (Generally) are onely careful to fix upon a Spiritual Object; Whereas the Suitableneſs of their Affections is as Eſſentially required of them, elſe are they neither Holy, nor will be Laſting. And though there is an Holy Driving Terror, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. and other Drawing Conſiderations, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 4. yet will our Motion never be Perpetual, ſave as our being Wiſdom's Children, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 19. is evinced by the Naturalneſs of our Affection to its Naked Wayes. And to that end, let us not too much eve Encouragements in ſuch a way, leſt by that means our Love ſhould be Debaſed: But let thoſe Chambers (or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations) be ſo joyned to the Temple of our Duty, as that their Beams may not be faſtned into its Wall, according to God's own Order, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. 6. elſe will it Threaten both the Weakning and Defacing of that Houſe, in caſe thoſe Chambers be taken down, which otherwiſe is no way Diſ-advantaged.</p>

                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:50213:86"/> 9. Let us be careful with whom we Ordinarily (at leaſt-wiſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately) do Converſe, ſince though Communion with the Wiſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſecure the Fooliſh Virgins Lamps from Going out; yet are Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions apt to Influence, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 20. <hi>Saul</hi> (if among the Prophets) will alſo Propheſy, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 24.

Affection for Duty (ſince the Fall) is very crazy; and Perſons (Aguiſhly Diſpoſed) upon the ſight of others ſo Affected, are apt to ſhake. Thus many Hopeful Virgins (of later Years) have Buried their Ancient Love (for Duty) in the Boſom of a Diſ-affected Yoak-fellow; which is a fair Warning unto Others to Marry in the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 39. Come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> for fear of being Touched with her Sins, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 4. Since any one Root of Bitterneſs is apt to Trouble and Defile, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 15. though it be but a little Leaven, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6. Conſult Experiences, and let us Act accordingly.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Let us endeavour to aſhame our ſelves, both by our Own and Others Practices, provoking hereunto. Oh how Affectionate are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in their way, Doting upon their Lovers, <hi>Ezek</hi> 23. 10. and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to out-vye each other in their Inordinacy, <hi>v.</hi> 11. Yea, falling in Love with Pourtraitures upon the Wall, <hi>v.</hi> 14. 16. and being inflamed with the Remembrance of former Lewdneſs, <hi>v.</hi> 19. 21. And is it not a ſhame that Chriſt ſhould have leſs Love than Satan? Nay Saints them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have heretofore been Zealous in an Evil way, as <hi>Paul</hi> had been, who therefore (when he was Converted) followed after Holineſs in himſelf, as he had ſometimes Perſecuted it in others, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 6. 12.

Nor can it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, but that Saints have Affections ſtill, who can give no good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for their Abatement toward Chriſt, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 5. 31. and in that caſe, as Chriſt will not Accept the Creatures Leavings, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 8. ſo doth he ſadly Curſe ſuch a Deceitful Sacrificer, <hi>v.</hi> 14. and ſuch a puff upon a Candle new blown out, may be of uſe to blow it in again; yea with the Help of Chriſt's Breath therein, and of his Hand behind it, this may regain the deadeſt Lamp.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Let us be deeply Humbled in the ſence of our Decaying Love for Chriſt, as we would ever get it up again, and keep it Lively.

Conſcience in <hi>David</hi> was faſt aſleep when he could be ſo fierce againſt that in Another, whereof him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was then ſo Guilty, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 5, 6, 7. 'Tis meet for Slumberers
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:50213:87"/> to Rub their Eyes, before they can Diſcern (at leaſt Reprove) ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ſluggiſhneſs. Chriſt's Teaching was Authoritative, in Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition with that of Hypocrites, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 29. whoſe guilty Conſcience (when Appealed unto) made them Deſiſt from proſecuting their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of another, <hi>John</hi> 8. 7. 9. And as thoſe Typical Snuffers were made of pureſt Gold, <hi>Exod.</hi> 37. 23. ſo Perſons Newly Raiſed from a Fall, have ſeldom ſo much Confidence, as to Rebuke their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, till throughly purified from Enfeebling guilt.</p>
                  <p>4. They might be Tender in Judging upon the preſent caſe; how far a failing of this Nature was their ſin; or how far ſuch a ſin might be conſiſtent with the Main; or whether their Lamps were not Recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: And therefore onely might Exhort inſtead of ſharp Rebuking. Chriſt did more deeply Cenſure the Fooliſh Virgins of his Time, than his Diſciples could well bear, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 12. and ſome Wiſe Virgins (at this Day) like not ſuch kind of Tartneſs. Few are Convinced, that Ignorance doth not Excuſe from ſin, or that Time-Duties are of ſuch Importance, as to have Saint-ſhip gathered up thereinto: who therefore dare not Judge Men upon that Account. And ſince the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo much calls for Gentleneſs, it is a thing ſo grateful of it ſelf, as that few Men can bear it's Contrary in any caſe, though every whit as plainly Warranted, eſpecially among Back-ſliders. But thoſe Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting Witneſſes were onely Two, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 10. the Generality are Moderate.</p>
                  <p>5. Wiſe Virgins alway are Inferiour to the Fooliſh, in point of Intereſt; which is a ſore Temptation, not to Irritate, and which but few can overcome. Soundeſt Profeſſors generally are Poor, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with others, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 8. and Poor Men uſe Intreaties, leaving rough Anſwers to the Rich, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 23. who ſeldom themſelves are ſo dealt with, ſave by a more than Ordinary Prophet, as of Old. Sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Profeſſors alſo are but few: And where is that <hi>Micajah,</hi> who da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to Rebuke four hundred Lying Flatterers? Yea, Fooliſh Virgins are of the firſt Magnitude, unto the dwellers upon Earth, as is the Moon, becauſe of its being nearer unto ſenſe: And as Proud <hi>Phariſees</hi> deride Plain dealing, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 14. preſuming upon their high Eſteem, <hi>v.</hi> 15 ſo none but Chriſt and <hi>John</hi> durſt roughly handle them, until the Spirit was poured down, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 17. 23. and when that Diſpenſation comes again, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32. 15. then ſtammerers will ſpeak plainly, <hi>ver.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>6. The Lord himſelf might have a Righteous Over-ruling Hand, in their being ſilent unto ſuch, at ſuch a Time. He hath the Key of Utterance, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 3. and when he Shutteth, no Man can Open, <hi>Rev.</hi>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:50213:88"/> 3. 7. A Moral (or Preceptive) Bar is alway laid upon his People's Reprehenſions, in ſome Caſes, or when clear Duties are Diſputed; <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thus <hi>Naaman</hi>'s halving it with God, (after ſo full a Conviction and Obliging Mercy,) was juſtly Puniſhed with <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s ſilence and ſeeming Approbation, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5. 17, 18, 19. The Time is Now haſtning, for God himſelf to Anſwer ſuch Hypocritical Enquirers of him, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 4. who therefore will not let his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſpeak, <hi>v.</hi> 3.

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. What is the Meaning of that Denial which is here made (by theſe Wiſe Virgins) unto the Fooliſh Virgins Motion for Oyl or Light?</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Negatively.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is not to be underſtood, as if the Wiſe Virgins were (in the leaſt) unwilling to have lent what Help they could, in caſe the Other had been truly ſerious. This would not have conſiſted with their Wiſdom, but would have ſignified their being alſo Fooliſh; ſince the Lips of the Wiſe Diſperſe Knowledge, but the Heart of the Fooliſh doth not ſo, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 7. A Gracious Heart Longeth to Impart that Spiritual Gift, whereof he doth partake, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 11. doing therein to Others, as he would be dealt with by them, <hi>v.</hi> 12. Oyl is Diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, eſpecially where Gifts and Graces are in Conjunction: therefore it ſadly ſignifieth, when utmoſt Spiritual Help is not Afforded, from Envy, Sluggiſhneſs, or Spiritual Pride: Satan may Hinder, once and again, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 18. ſo may Diverſions otherways, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 22. Yea, ſometimes <hi>Paul</hi> was Hindred by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 6, 7. who elſe did count himſelf a Debtor unto All, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nor is it meant, as if the Wiſe Virgins (abſolutely) were unable to have given Oyl unto the Fooliſh. 'Tis true, all Man's ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency (for ſuch a work) is of the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. as well as Efficacy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7. yet are Men workers together with him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1. who therefore have this Oyl or Treaſure in their Earthen Veſſels, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Paul</hi> could Beget, in Bonds, <hi>Philem.</hi> 10. and he that is not Able to be a Spiritual Father, was Typically of Old debarred from that Prieſt-hood, <hi>Lev.</hi> 21. 20. which was a Type of Goſpel Saint-ſhip, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. nor might ſuch enter into the Congregation, or be Accounted <hi>Iſraelites, Deut.</hi> 23. 1. Nor will the Saints Oyl (in this Reſpect) forbear to Multiply, ſo long as there are any choſen Veſſels
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:50213:88"/> left for it to over-flow into, as 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 6. or not untill Election hath done bearing Children; and then this Oyl will ſtay, as did that Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, ſerving to pay its Owners Debts, and for Subſiſtance, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 7.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nor is that Cautionary Reaſon <hi>[Leſt there be not enough for us and you]</hi> to be Interpreted, as if this Spiritual Contribution would Exhauſt the Wiſer Virgins ſtore, as at the firſt bluſh it ſeemeth to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. There was no Leſſening of Chriſt's Vertue, by what went from him, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 46. nor is the Sun darkened by its ſhining: Nor is a Saint the Poorer for his Spiritual Liberality. Yea, Grace is thus kept Bright with Uſe, which otherwiſe might gather Ruſt, and ſo Corrupt, as Gold it ſelf is apt to Canker, <hi>James</hi> 5. 3. unto its Owner's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage. And as unmeet with holding tendeth unto Poverty, ſo he Increaſeth, who duly ſcattereth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 24. and watereth himſelf by watering others, <hi>v.</hi> 25 as Talent-Occupiers do Experience, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 20. Lamps, in the Letter and Myſtery, herein Agree, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them are Diminiſhed by Lighting Others: Myſtical Lamps herein are ſingular, becauſe their Oyl is Multiplyed by Diſtribution. Thus much as to the Negative. But then,</p>
                  <p>II. Affirmatively. They might thus ſpeak unto the Fooliſh Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To prove the Cordialneſs of their Deſire, if not to check their ſleightineſs and Carnality therein. When that <hi>Samaritan</hi> Woman ſleightily and Carnally deſired Chriſt's Ever-living water, <hi>John</hi> 4. 15. he onely Anſwered her with a Diverſion, <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>q. d.</hi> I will be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſought unto before a Motion of that Nature ſhall be ſatisfied. However Cordialneſs is thus Expreimented. Thus <hi>Joſhua</hi> tryed the Truth of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Profeſſing to Serve the Lord, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24. 16. by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting of it, <hi>v.</hi> 19. till they had Doubted it, <hi>v.</hi> 21. and then he let it paſs, <hi>v.</hi> 22. Thus <hi>Naomi</hi> refuſed <hi>Ruth's</hi> firſt Reſolution to Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany her, <hi>Ruth</hi> 1. 10. 15. meerly to prove her ſtedfaſtneſs, <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17, 18. as did <hi>Elijah</hi> to <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 Kings 2. 2. and Chriſt himſelf unto thoſe two Diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 24 28, 29. Had not the Fooliſh Virgins been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, ſo Modeſt a Denial would have wrought another way; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Tryal was not unwiſely made.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To Check the Fooliſh Virgins coming Onely unto them for Oyl, without any further Pains or Coſt, who therefore bid them <hi>(rather) Go to them that Sell, and Buy.</hi> Thus <hi>Naaman</hi> was bid to Go and Waſh in <hi>Jordan,</hi> 2 Kings 5. 10. and thoſe Ten Lepers to Go and ſhew themſelves unto the Prieſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 14. and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to Buy of <hi>Eſan,</hi> Meat and Water, <hi>Deut.</hi> 2. 6. not from unwillingneſs to Gratifie
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:50213:89"/> them upon other terms, but to Rebuke ſelf-love. And though a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Heart is free to do for others what he can, yet doth he ſend ſuch to Chriſt, as without whom he can do nothing; and who doth chiefly ſeek his Glory. Thus to diſſwade from Terminating upon Inſtruments (after a work is done) was <hi>Peter</hi>'s Vertue, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 12. and thus to ſend (before hand) the Fooliſh Virgins unto Chriſt, was the Wiſe Virgins ſelf-denyal. It is our Grace and Duty not to ſatisfie anothers wiſh, when either God is likely to be Robbed, or ſome more ſad Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper to be Indulged.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To ſhew the Wiſe Virgins ſenſe of having Oyl little enough, and none to ſpare, as (in Propriety of Speech) the Other's Motion did import: Therefore theſe Anſwer, <hi>Leſt there be not enough for us and you.</hi> As he that Loveth Silver, is not ſatisfied, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5. 10. So he that Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Oyl (or Grace, and Spiritual Light,) is as the Sea, which is not Full, though all the Rivers run into it, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 1. 7. Thus is a truly Gracious Heart Diſtinguiſhed from Hypocrites, by his being alway fearful, leſt he ſhould not have Oyl enough, which others are afraid of having too much of. And more eſpecially Wiſe Virgins are ſollicitous, with reference unto Time-Truths and Duties; which are Expenſive, and therefore need the greater S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ock: Yea; which are alſo very Curious, and therefore need the cleareſt Light. 'Tis true, their Lighting others is no way ſelf-diminiſhing; but their Denial here may onely intimate unto the other, how Low they were in their own Eyes, and what an High eſteem they had of Oyl, as to its Worth and Uſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To ſignifie (perhaps) how Difficult it was for them to make this Preſent Duty out, unto another, above Moſt other Duties. 'Tis true, Time-Truths are very Plain, as Excellent things are, to him that Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 6. 9. yet are they hardly to be underſtood by Others, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. and to be uttered by the Beſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 11. Few at this Day perceive that More is in this Second going forth, than at the Firſt: Nor can it be yet made out, but with a ſtammering Lip, as was fore-told, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 11. or with a ſtrange Tongue, as <hi>Paul</hi> explaineth it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 21. Truths are but rarely ſeen, at their firſt coming up, till God (in Time) ſhall make ſome clearer Revelation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 15. or till the Cuſtomary Practice of Sober Chriſtians, ſhall ſilence them who ſeem to be Contentious, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 14. 16. Let not the Fooliſh Virgins wonder, in caſe the Wiſe (at firſt) have no more Light into untrodden Paths, than will juſt ſerve their turn; as is here hinted.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Theſe bid the Other go, and Buy Oyl for Themſelves; becauſe they would have them ſee with their Own Eyes, and not with Others, in Matters of this Nature. Unſound Profeſſors (like ſome bad Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands)
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:50213:89"/> Live moſt upon Borrowing: But Goſpel-Saints are for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of their Own work, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 4. and working with their Own Hand, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 11. and being perſwaded in their own Heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 5. Thus ſhall Men have Rejoycing in their own ſelves, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 4. Thus ſhall they have Reward, according to their own Labour, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 8. thus Trees are to be known by their own Fruit, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 46. nor will the Beſt Seed abide with him, which hath not Root in Himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 21. Therefore Wiſe Men are onely for the Uſe and Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of what is their own, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 15, 16, 17. and they who make the Truth their own, have right to call Heaven their own alſo, though Earthly <hi>Mammon</hi> be Another's, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 11, 12. and this is Buying for ones ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They might thus ſpeak to get rid of the Others Company, whom they now had no Pleaſure in, ſo much as to Diſcourſe any longer with them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Partly, Becauſe of their Back-ſliding from a former Practice and Profeſſion. They had gone out Before; but now their Lamps were Gone, or Going out, and with a Noiſom ſmell unto theſe Wiſer Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, which might Occaſion this Quick (though Fair) Diſmiſſion. God hath no Pleaſure in him that draweth back, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 38. becauſe Apoſtates are as Smoak unto his Noſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 5. therefore Chriſt will not Parley with theſe late Returners, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 12. no more than do theſe other now. Nor is it to be wondred at, ſince Myſtical Lamps are apt to go out for Company, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 12. yea, their very Snuffs are moſt Offenſive, like Dead Mens Carkaſſes, which do Occaſion thoſe Alive to ſtop their Noſes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39 11. and ſo their Speech muſt needs be Hindred. As Men would have Diſcourſe (with Chriſt, or with his People) to be Convinced; ſo let them take heed of wearying others with ſuch bad Savours, or Dead Affections.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Wiſe Virgins might perceive their being unlikely to Convince the other, by any thing Offered for ſuch a purpoſe. Theſe Fooliſh Virgins (Doubtleſly) had already heard, what could be ſaid, and wherefore ſhould they hear the ſame again, who had no mind to be the Truth's Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 9. 27? The Cry had cleared up the Nature of this Duty: Nor do they Complain of wanting ought, but Lamps, or good Affections thereunto; and when the Judgment is not Supream, 'tis but in vain to Reaſon with Mens Affections. It was an Argument of <hi>Abigail</hi>'s Wiſdom, to be ſilent, till <hi>Nabal</hi>'s Reaſon was Reſtored, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 26. 27. nor will Men Plough upon the Rock, <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 12. yea, Saints are bid with-draw from ſtrifes of Words, and from Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Diſputings, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 4, 5. If Men will not Believe, Chriſt will
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:50213:90"/> ſay little, <hi>Luke</hi> 32. 67. And if Wiſe Virgins be not like to Profit Others, they will not vex Themſelves with vain Diſcourſe.</p>

                  <p>Now, as to Saints, the Generality of Profeſſors are intended by theſe Virgins; therefore They cannot be the Sellers here, ſince half of them do bid the other half, to Go and Buy elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true indeed, there have been Two Anointed ones (or Sons of Oyl) by way of Eminency, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 14. who (with Reſpect to Chriſt) are termed Olive-Branches, <hi>v.</hi> 12. but Olive-Trees, with reference unto others, <hi>v.</hi> 11. and theſe are ſaid to Empty the Golden Oyl out of Themſelves, through their Two Golden Pipes, <hi>v.</hi> 12. or Sanctified Mediums, <hi>viz.</hi> the VVord and Prayer, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5. And this is (in Effect) to Sell; ſo that ſuch Eminently enlightned ones (or the Maintainers of others Lamps with Oyl, <hi>Zech</hi> 4. 2, 3.) may fitly ſhare (with Chriſt himſelf) in ſuch a Title, above the Generality of Profeſſors. Onely it thence will follow, that ſlumbring (wiſe) Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins are no Proper VVitneſſes; ſince (when Awakened) they do not Challenge to themſelves the Name of Oyl-Emptyers, (or Sellers of it unto Others,) which yet is given by Chriſt unto the VVitneſſes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 4.</p>
                  <p>But yet I rather chuſe to give this Title (here) to Chriſt alone, who is the Heir of all things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2. and conſequently, the ſole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor, or Proper Seller of this Commodity.

                  <p n="1">1. Tradeſmen have ſtore of what they put to Sale, and ſo hath Chriſt. Here is enough for him and others; therein he differeth from theſe Wiſe Virgins.

                  <p n="2">2. A Tradeſman hath Authority to Sell, and ſo hath Chriſt. He is the Proprietor of what he hath, by Vertue of the Father's Gift, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18. and his own Purchaſe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 8, 9. and is it not Lawful for him then, to do what he will with his own, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 18?

                  <p n="4">4. That which a Tradeſman Selleth, is the Buyers own, between them two; ſo is it between a Soul and Chriſt.

Onely Chriſt herein dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth much from other Tradeſmen, becauſe Himſelf is not Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, nor is the Soul at all Impoveriſhed by any of thoſe terms inſiſted on. Which are as followeth:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You muſt Come unto him. His Chapmen are oftner bid to Come, than Buy, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1. to intimate, that if they mean to Buy, they muſt be ſure to Come. He May be found of ſuch as do not ſeek him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 1. but Ordinarily he will be firſt Enquired of, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 37. <hi>Joſeph</hi> had Corn enough, yet muſt his own Brethren Come and Buy, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 2. yea, they muſt come again, or ſtarve, <hi>Gen.</hi> 43. 2. And then he hath his Price, although they had their Money ſtill, <hi>v.</hi> 22, 23. Yea, they muſt Come to Him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28. and not unto their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows onely, as did theſe Fooliſh Virgins. The Father hath Committed all to him, <hi>John</hi> 5. 22. as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did to <hi>Joſeph, Gen.</hi> 41. 55. ſuch alſo muſt Come, as Coming doth import Believing, <hi>John</hi> 6. 35. not Abſolutely with Reſpect to full Aſſurance, in point of Preſent or Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Intereſt; but yet with reference to his Ability and Will, upon ſuch terms as are propounded by him, <hi>James</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. and by a Special Faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You muſt come Mourning over all your former ſleightineſs and Provocations. Acknowledge your Offence, till when he Goeth from you, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5. 15. but humble your ſelves, then will he Hear, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. 14. take with you Words, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 2. as did that Prodigal, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 18, 19. ſo will this Father Run and Meet you, <hi>v.</hi> 20. Thus muſt Tranſgreſſors come, Going and Weeping, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 4. which doth evince their being led by him, in a ſtraight way, and their being wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to him as a Father, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 9. <hi>Pour out thine Heart like Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before his Face,</hi> Lam. 2. 19. which is a Secondary kind of waſhing, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>Then Come</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and let us Reaſon,</hi> v. 18 and Self-bemoaners are Affectionately remembred by him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 18. 20. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in water, is (in Appearance) double; onely this water muſt be clear, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10. and you muſt put no value thereupon, however Chriſt accounteth of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You muſt reduce indefinite deſires into Particulars. When Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men come into a Shop to Buy, they are firſt asked, What would you have? Blind <hi>Bartimeus</hi> cryed unto Chriſt, (Indefinitely at firſt) <hi>Thou Son of</hi> David, <hi>have Mercy on me,</hi> Mark 10. 47. but when he came to Jeſus, <hi>v.</hi> 50. Chriſt asked him, <hi>What</hi> (in Particular) <hi>he would have done-unto him,</hi> v. 51. Chriſt onely Echoeth unto the Creatures Voice; which (if Particular) is ſuitably replyed unto, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 51, 52.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:50213:92"/> till when, his Call is as Indefinite, <hi>v.</hi> 49. as is the others Cry, <hi>v.</hi> 48. And therein have a Care to pitch upon what is of greateſt Worth and Need; ſo will Inferiour things be added, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 33. without asking, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. 11. 13. You would have Oyl, (ſaith Chriſt,) what kind of Oyl? The very Beſt (ſay you) the Pureſt Oyl: So may you have both it, and what is Common alſo.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. His Offer muſt be duly Prized. It may be Tendred unto All, but is not Sold, ſave unto ſuch who thereto Eminently are Invited, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28. There muſt be ſo much ſenſe, both of its Worth, and of our Need thereof, as to Provoke the Will, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17. elſe ſhall we never Buy it of him. 'Tis true, there is a Paſſive Union firſt, (or pre-communication of Chriſt's Commodity) which doth Beget Deſire; but till there be an Active cloze, (proceeding from that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire Exerciſed,) there is no Full or Proper Intereſt. It is a Marriage-contract this, wherein the Man firſt takes the Woman, but ſhe muſt alſo take the Man; till when, the Marriage is not Compleated: Nor can ought elſe be Sold or Bought.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. You muſt receive this Oyl into your Veſſels, elſe will Chriſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Sell it, meerly to feed your Lamps, or flaſhy Preſent good Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It was not deſired by theſe Fooliſh Virgins, ſave onely with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto their Lamps; and therefore (Poſſibly) the Wiſe Denyed them; ſo will Chriſt certainly. In caſe you would have Oyl (ſaith Chriſt) where is your Veſſel? <hi>Give me thine Heart,</hi> Prov. 23. 26. <hi>and I will fill it,</hi> Pſal. 81. 10. If there be no Veſſel, his Oyl will ſtay, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 6. and 'tis Abſurd to think, that Oyl (or Wiſdom) can be Subjected, ſave in the Judgment. Some onely would have Oyl ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to their Itching Ears; others, unto their Tongue, to make it Nimble; others, unto ſome VVound, till it be Healed: But Grace or VViſdom is not Thine, unleſs it entreth into thine Heart, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 10. no more than ſinful Temptations are, untill the Heart be therewith filled.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Your Veſſels alſo muſt be Emptied, elſe can you not Receive his Oyl, which is not Sold by him, untill it be immediately Delivered. Some other Liquors will Incorporate; but Darkneſs will as ſoon Agree with Light, as Sin with Grace. Some fain would keep their Puddle-water ſtill; and ſo Chriſt's Oyl ſhould ſpill upon the Ground, which he will not endure. And what a Fool is he, who doth refuſe Chriſt's ſtately Robes, becauſe he may not have them put upon his Filthy Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Let go your Airy ſelf-conceit; elſe that alone may be ſufficient to Obſtruct the beſt Repleniſhment: As in a Stomach filled with wind. Yea, Chriſt will not be won, ſave with the Loſs of Common Oyl, and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:50213:92"/> all thoſe things which heretofore have been Accounted Gain, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 7, 8.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. You muſt receive the whole of his Commodity. Chriſt is an whole-Sale Merchant onely. He is a Vine, whoſe Fruit is Cluſtered. He doth not Sell his Oyl by Drops or Spoonfu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s; you muſt have All or None. His Water is not to be had, but by a Quill united to his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit-Pipe. Some are ſo Moderate, ſo Partial in their Deſires, as that Chriſt hath no mind to Parley with them. Yea, his whole Shop and Perſon too muſt go together, to every of his Speeding Chapmen; <hi>Ruth</hi> and her Land might not be ſeparated, <hi>Ruth</hi> 4. 5. And what a Mercy is it unto Saints, that Chriſt and all his Spiritual Bleſſings are thus Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3. unto their being made Compleat in him, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 10.

You muſt be willing to lay all down, both in a Myſtical and Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſence, giving him leave to Take it if he pleaſeth, and without grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4. Why doth Chriſt chuſe to Sell his Oyl?</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That ſo it might be Repreſented ſure; as being fairly Bought and Sold. Gifts are depending upon the Givers good Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13. 11. but <hi>Jacob</hi> kept the Birth-right ſtill, which he had Bought, (and conſequently, the Bleſſing alſo) though <hi>Eſau</hi> Hated him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 41. And though God's ſpecial Gifts are ſaid to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 29. yet is a Doubting Conſcience better ſatisfied with Chriſt's being ſaid (as here) to Sell it, according unto Common Rules of Judging. Therefore God Buys his People with a Price, that ſo they might be His, without Diſpute, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20. Yea, therefore he ſometimes Sold them unto others, <hi>Judg.</hi> 2. 14. to make thoſe Buyers think, they had a Lawful Title to them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 24. Now, God is willing to ſhew abundantly his own Immutability unto the Heirs of Promiſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 17. who therefore calls his Gift their Purchaſe.</p>
                  <p>2. To hint the Worth of his Commodities. Gifts uſually are leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer things; as Thread and Paper: But things of Worth are Evidenced by a Price demanded. Indeed Chriſt is Invaluable, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 11. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt be Given, or not be had: But yet the Soul muſt Buy him with his All, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 44. to ſhew his Worth as much as may be. Men will not Run and Cry for Apprehended Trifles; therefore there doing onely ſo for Chriſt, doth intimate his being Valued by them. Eſpecially when <hi>Paul</hi> did freely ſuffer the Loſs of All things for his ſake, Accounting his former attainments Dung, Compared with him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. And though a ſinners ſin is nothing, becauſe it wants the good of Being; yea, worſe than Nothing, becauſe that Soul had better not have Been, <hi>Met.</hi> 26. 24. Yet is it his right Eye, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 29. the Loſs whereof doth Argue Higheſt Valuation, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 15.</p>
                  <p>3. That ſo his Chapmen's Honour (as well as Satisfaction) might be conſulted for, by him, (and by this means) together with his own. He hath made all things (Firſtly) for Himſelf, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 4 becauſe there is no Higher End; which therefore doth accordingly Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige his Creatures in all their Actings, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31. who alſo are
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:50213:94"/> Encouraged to Honour him, by his conſulting for their Honour, in a Second place, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30. He doth put Honour upon Himſelf, by ſtanding upon ſome kind of Price: His People alſo do much Honour him, by their Accepting him upon his own Propoſals: And he will therefore alſo have them Buy, that ſo their Generouſneſs might be thus Evidenced (as was by <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 23, 24.) And ſeeming Riches, who can thus Purchaſe their very Purchaſer, by that precious Faith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1. which is ſo All-commanding, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 18.</p>
                  <p>4. To ſignifie its being not to be Challenged, as a Debt; nor upon Terms, ſave with its Owner's Leave. That which is fairly Sold, may be Demanded, in way of Righteouſneſs; therefore if Saints confeſs, <hi>The Lord is Juſt and Faithful to Forgive,</hi> 1 John 1. 9. becauſe (in Chriſt) they have laid down his Price; till when, both Parties are at Liberty. A Tenant's Rent may be Required, but not a Tradeſman's unbought Ware: Nor can ſuch be Conſtrained to Sell, no more than Chapmen are to Buy. No Fleſh muſt Glory in His preſence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 29. which as the Freeneſs of his Gift conſulteth for, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 9. ſo doth his Sale: That ſo, his being Diſ-obliged might Appear, both as a Benefactor, and as a Tradeſman; which doth Exclude all kind of Boaſting.</p>
                  <p>5. That ſo his Commodity might be the more Endeared, as Bought things are. Propriety (though meerly from a Gift) doth much En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 3. eſpecially when it is purchaſed; as that Ew-Lamb was as his Daughter who had bought it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 3. Thus <hi>Jacob</hi> would be Buried in that Field which <hi>Abraham</hi> Bought, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 29, 30. He that had Bought a piece of Ground, muſt needs go ſee it, though at a Coſtly Rate, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 18. And <hi>Sion</hi>'s prime Argument with God, to be remembred, was, her having been his Ancient purchaſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74. 2. Mothers (uſually) are moſt Affectionate, becauſe their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren coſt Them Deareſt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 3. and 31. 2. and God is very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of thoſe whom he hath purchaſed with his own Blood, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. So was Chriſt unto <hi>Paul,</hi> whom he had won (or Bought) with Loſing all his former Gains, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
                  <p>6. That Fooliſh Virgins might be Diſcovered, who fain would have Oyl Freely Given, and keep their Money ſtill, from ſinful ſleightineſs, and baſe ſelf-love, if not from Envy, and for a wicked End. The pooreſt Chapman hath ſome Money, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 2. which he might keep, if it would either profit him, or not be vainly ſpent elſe-where: And in that Caſe, he doth but ſhew his own unworthineſs, who Grudgeth Chriſt the having of it. Thoſe Men deſerve to be uncaſed by him, who will not give (for his Commodity) what doth not profit them to keep;
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:50213:95"/> and from a Deſign thereby to Act unto his Diſ-advantage. Thus alſo will their Mouth be ſtopt, with reference unto their being Denied, and others Speeding, ſince his Commodity is at the Buyers Service.</p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> How is that Freely Given, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 15. which yet is Sold? Either by God or Chriſt.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Father Selleth, becauſe the Son laid down his price, unto the full, in point of Matter, for his Elect; both as to God's vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive Juſtice, and Diſtributive. Vindictive Juſtice had her Full pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from him, for the ſins of his Elect; becauſe he was made ſin for them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. and was not Spared or Remitted, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. Diſtributive Juſtice had her Full, becauſe he did whatever the Law required, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26. whoſe Univerſal Righteouſneſs (without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining it unto his Death) is that by which his people Reign in Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 17. Yet is it alſo There called a Gift, becauſe the Benefit of his Obedience is made over unto Others, which Rigorous Juſtice doth not Admit; and therefore it is onely pleaded at the Throne of Grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 16. Thus Selling and Free Giving are conſiſtent, with Reſpect unto the Father.</p>
                  <p>2. The Son doth alſo Freely Give, though he is here ſaid to Sell.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe the price (inſiſted on) is Nothing, Compared with the Worth of his Commodity. This Oyl (or Wiſdom) is Invaluable; man knoweth not the price thereof, <hi>Job</hi> 28. 13. it cannot be got for Gold or precious Stones, <hi>v.</hi> 15, 16. yea, all the things to be Deſired are not to be Compared with it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 11. How then can thoſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named terms be called a price? VVhich either Relate to filthy Rags, or Matters of no Real worth at all, ſave in a perſon's Eſtimation. Now, if a Pepper-corn be paid, it hath the Name of Price, in Law; but if an Earldom ſhould be Sold for one braſs Farthing, would it be therefore ſaid, Not to be Given? Therefore Chriſt's proper Name muſt needs be <hi>Giver;</hi> however, Commonly, he may be called a Seller: His Name is VVonderful, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 6. or a Free-Giving Tradeſman.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe Himſelf is not Advantaged by any of that fore-ſaid Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or as the Buyer is, by his Commodity; which therefore (as to Him) is Freely Given. VVhat gets He by thy Coming to him? He Bottleth up his people's Tears, not for Their VVorth, but as his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morandum, Pſal.</hi> 56. 8, 9. The Emptyings of thy Veſſel are no Gain to Him, as thy partaking of his Fulneſs is to Thee. And as thy Praiſes add no Real greatneſs to him; ſo what Receiveth he of thy hand, if thou be Righteous, <hi>Job</hi> 35. 7. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. 5? Yet will no Man be at this Coſt and pains, who doth not Value this Commodity above thoſe Terms. From whence it followeth, that as the Creature is a Buyer, ſo Cariſt is properly a Giver, though called a Seller.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="185" facs="tcp:50213:95"/> 3. Becauſe the Chapman is not Damaged, but much Enriched by his very parting with this Money, as well as by what is Exchanged for it. Thy very Coming unto Chriſt, is both a Labour and Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28, 29. Thy Godly ſorrow is not to be Repented of, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10. no more than ſweating in a Fever. Thy Thirſting after him, doth make his Taſte the more Delightful, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27 7. It is a Mercy to have thy Veſſel Emptied of what is in it; and yet a greater Mercy to have it called for, in Order to its being filled with Grace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81. 10. Yea, it is not for thine Advantage, to have his Oyl run ſomewhat Thick at firſt, and Clearer afterwards, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 25? Its being Improved for Him, will prove thy Gain at laſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 16, 17. ſo will thy greateſt Loſſes for its ſake, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 10. the Expectation whereof doth onely make continued Enjoyments ſo much the more ſafe and ſweet, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 17. 19.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe he is the Sole Proprietor, as of his own Commodity, ſo of the Buyer's Money alſo: And in that caſe, ſelf-payers are Free-Givers. Thou canſt not check him with thy Coming to him, becauſe thou Liveſt and Moveſt in him, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 28. Thy ſorrow is an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in thee, of his Creating; the Exerciſe whereof thy ſin hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo made to be a Moral Debt. What haſt thou (as to Outward Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,) which thou haſt not Received from him, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 10, 11, 12? And may he not then Require their being All laid down, without a Commutation? Thine whole Activity is from himſelf; thy Praiſes and Improvements are his Due: Yea, he it is who worketh in thee, to Will and Do, according to the Terms propoſed, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if <hi>Abraham</hi> were Juſtified by works, he hath whereof to Glory, but not before the Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 2. for who hath firſt given to him, and it ſhall be Recompenſed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 35. elſe paying him with his own, doth onely evidence the Freeneſs of his Gift.</p>

                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. VViſe Virgins have very Low and Jealous thoughts of their own Spiritual ſtock, as is here ſignified; and more eſpecially, when Newly wakened out of their ſinful ſlumbring, for which there is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Reaſon. Sleep is Expenſive, as Sickneſs is, whereof this is one kind; and therefore Love it not, for fear of coming unto Poverty, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 13. However ſuch are apt to be ſuſpitious, beyond their Ground; Departure from the Lord, being both the Fruit of unbelief, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 12. and cauſe of ſuch-like Doubting. Yea, a Returning Prodigal is to be known by Holy humble Apprehenſions of his worth, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 19. and Oyl or VViſdom, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7. 23. Indeed, the truly wiſe are ever Lowly, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 2. whilſt others think they have Enough, not onely for Themſelves and Others help, but alſo to ſpare ſome part for
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:50213:96"/> Satan, who therefore are bold to dally with his Temptations; but ſuch Men's Folly ſhews their Real want of Oyl, or wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>3. Wiſe Virgins are (in the firſt place) for Themſelves, with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto their Spiritual Intereſt. It is not onely warrantable, but (in this caſe) it is their Duty and their Wiſdom. In Outward things Man ought to Love his Neighbour as Himſelf, in Oppoſition unto Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 18. and in Reſpect of Truth, though not Degree, ſave in ſome more than Ordinary Caſes, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. but not in Spirituals. And though <hi>Paul</hi> wiſht himſelf accurſt from Chriſt (for others) in point of Spiritual Priviledges, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 3. wherein he alſo might have a Special warrant; yet did he not wiſh his being a Tranſgreſſor for their ſake, ſave as Chriſt was by way of Imputation. God's Glory ſhould be preferred by us, before our own Salvation; but let us not do Evil, though Good may come, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 8. in that Reſpect, <hi>v.</hi> 7. Therefore, with reference unto Duty, it was the Spouſe's Grief, that ſhe had kept others Vineyards, and not our own, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
                  <p>3. Wiſe Virgins are very loath to ſay, <hi>Not ſo,</hi> unto a Motion made for Spiritual help, in any caſe whatever. Thoſe words <hi>[Not ſo]</hi> are not in the <hi>Greek,</hi> but added by our Tranſlators, as being grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wiſe Virgins ſilence. Nor do they Abſolutely bid the other Go elſewhere, but onely rather; and with Reſpect unto the Fooliſh Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins greater benefit, who by that means might have Oyl without bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing. Some do with-hold anothers Due, when it is in the power of their hand to do it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 27. but Saints are forward to be Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. 5. ſave as meer Duty doth forbid them: Chriſt had Compaſſion upon others, and as with reference unto their Bodies, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 32. ſo much more with Reſpect unto their Souls, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 34. And Chriſtians have their Name from him; nor are Men worthy to be ſo called, in caſe they be of <hi>Nabal</hi>'s Churliſh Diſpoſition, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 11.</p>
                  <p>4. Wiſe Virgins are for giving ſatisfaction unto others, with reference unto their very Negatives. Some will not hear the ſtrongeſt Reaſon Offered againſt themſelves, <hi>Zech.</hi> 7. 11. theſe Men are Beaſts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 32. Others will give no Reaſon for their Practice, but their Will, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 9. theſe are not Prudent Men, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 16. Others ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that every Light Excuſe ſhould ſerve the turn, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 18. but thoſe were Carnal Jews, or Fooliſh Virgins. How ſhamefully have ſome endeavoured to ſilence thoſe with Childiſh Anſwers, who have been ſerious in deſiring Oyl, or Spiritual help. But Grace is not for Dallying, eſpecially not in Momentous caſes, but alway is provided of a Rational Anſwer with Holy fear, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. expecting that
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:50213:96"/> Chriſt will one day call for an Account (or Reaſon) of Idle words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 36. Nor can they be ſuppoſed to have Faith, who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable or Abſurd, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 2.</p>
                  <p>5. Poor Fooliſh Virgins are not likely (in theſe latter days) to gain Oyl from the Wiſe by their Communion with them, or addreſſes to them. Together with the Riſing of God's Light and Glory upon <hi>Sion,</hi> Profeſſors of an Earthy Spirit will be covered with Groſs Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. 1, 2. None of the wicked at ſuch a time ſhall underſtand, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 10. the Matters of their Peace will then be hidden from their Eyes, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 42. and as the unlearned (then) ſo will the Learned be, in point of Ignorance, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 11, 12. Chriſtians Communion (heretofore) may have been both Preventive and Recovering; but henceforth no more of that Vine, untill its Fruit ſhall be renewed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 29. Newly Awakened ones love not to ſtir; Helps ready to be laid aſide are very weak, and when the payment is, the work is over: Therefore this Diſpenſation muſt needs be fixing. I would not Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage from the uſe of Means, but Doubt their Efficacy at this Day, with Reſpect unto Fooliſh Virgins.</p>
                  <p>6. It may not be wondred at, if Wiſe and Fooliſh Virgins be Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved (in theſe latter days) to have but little Intercourſe, as is here ſignified. There is not any thing conſiderable doth befall us, but is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 7. if Men did but conſult the Scriptures, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 27. Thus, as to this particular, between the time of Chriſt's Aſcending, (which Anſwereth unto that of of his VVitneſſes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 12.) and the Deſcending of the Holy Ghoſt, (which Anſwereth unto the Seventh Trumpets ſounding,) Chriſt's Party were alone, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 13, 14. chooſing ſome other inſtead of <hi>Judas, v.</hi> 15. and did not meddle with the Jews till afterwards, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 1. which Anſwereth unto the Viols Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And thus, untill the Spirit (in theſe latter days) is poured from on High, the Fruitful Field (or Old Profeſſors) is counted for a Foreſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32. 15. not ſown with Exhortations, nor Ploughed with Reproofs. This Interval is rather a time of Prayer and ſilence, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 1. alluding unto that, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>7. VViſe Virgins (at ſuch a time) are freely willing to let the other Go from them, for mutual good. VVhat ſhall we then judge of them, or by what Name muſt they be called, who cannot bear a ſeparation from their Old Companions by any means? Some count it ſtrange, that others do forbear their wonted Intercourſe: But can a wiſe Man delight to Reaſon with unprofitable Talk, <hi>Job</hi> 15. 2, 3? Such are Exhorted to ſave Themſelves from that untoward Generation, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 40. who are Offended with plain down-right dealing, and Non-compliance with a
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:50213:97"/> ſinful Prohibition, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 28. Nor can the Fooliſh Virgins Go and Buy Oyl for themſelves, unleſs Communion with the wiſe be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, as is here hinted. The onely way to Benefit Apoſtates, is to let them Go; who otherwiſe are apt to Bleſs themſelves with being ſo far owned, therefore with-draw; 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 14.</p>
                  <p>8. VViſe Virgins lend what help they can, by way of Exhortation and Direction unto thoſe whom they may not be able to Inſtruct. This is the Laſt Remedy to be uſed; a bidding Ordinary means farewell; like that laſt digging about a Barren Fig-Tree, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 8, 9. or bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Matter unto <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 18. 26. Thus is the Spirits willingneſs Evinced, together with its weakneſs; thus is a Departing Saint's breath ſweet unto the laſt: thus is Chriſt Evidenced by them to be above them, and this is Grace's Valediction unto far-ſpent ſinners. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Man's utmoſt help is onely Miniſterial; and Chriſt reſerveth ſome peculiar work unto himſelf, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9. 18. whom therefore theſe wiſe Virgins ſend the other unto. VVhen Inſtruments are out of Breath, and Ordinary Means have tryed their utmoſt; yet is there hope in him, who can recover from the Grave: And thus far Grace is willing to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company a Dying Creature, which is the Laſt Office to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>9. Chriſt will be (now) Gone unto, by ſuch as want his Oyl or Light, and will not come to them, as heretofore his manner was, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 17. He will be Enquired of at ſuch a time, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 37. and will be ſought for, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3. 5. till when he Goeth and returneth to his place, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5. 15. or Heaven, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 30. The Temple ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time was his dwelling place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76. 2. but now his Glory is remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thence, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. 23. untill it ſhall Return, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43. 4. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt be followed by ſuch as mean to find him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 1, 2. This is the Fruit of ſinful Dallying, <hi>viz.</hi> the Hiding of his Face, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 20. or ſelf-with-drawing, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 6. and in that caſe, ſelf-ſtirring up is Neceſſary, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. 7. 'tis well if that will ſerve. Time-ſinners muſt not onely ſeek, but alſo ſtrive, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 24. and ſuch do but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves, if they conclude their having of this Oyl (which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly hath been Neglected) without ſome more than Ordinary Coſt and Pains, as is here ſignified.</p>
                  <p>10. Oyl <hi>[for our ſelves]</hi> was alway both our Duty and our wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to be Labouring after, which in theſe latter days will eminently be urged unto and inſiſted on by all wiſe Virgins. Foundations (now) will be Diſcovered, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 13. there will be no room for Borrowing; nor will Profeſſors be Advantaged, ſave by what is their own. Their Motion here doth evidence Chriſt's Deſign, which is, to have Men
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:50213:97"/> Principled for their Duty, and not to ſatisfie themſelves (as theſe poor Fooliſh Virgins would have done) with bare Revived Lamps or good Affections, wherewith Chriſt is not ſatisfied, nor his People. Wiſe Virgins may be known by this, their putting others upon ſelf-enquiries; who therefore will not lend a Form of Knowledge, leſt that ſhould ſatisfie without its Power. Such may be thought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; but as Chriſt hath a Righteous Hand therein, ſo they may have an Holy Aim, <hi>viz.</hi> the others greater Benefit.</p>
                  <p>11. There are Oyl-Sellers ſtill, whom Men are bid to Buy it of, as they would have it for Themſelves. Chriſt onely can Eſtate a Soul in Light, and by that means ſecure it; which elſe is apt to be Removed; nor will he Recompenſe a Man, ſave with Reſpect unto what is his own, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 8. But you muſt Buy it, and its Price hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſet; nor will one Farthing be abated: Therefore let none pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume his Intereſt therein, who hath not (doth not) come up unto thoſe fore-named Terms. And 'tis a Mercy that it may be had; which theſe Wiſe Virgins do ſuppoſe, elſe would they not have bid the other Go and Buy: Nor is the Door ſaid to have been ſhut till afterward, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 10. The near Approaching of which Day doth call for Mutual Exhortation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25. while it is called, <hi>To Day,</hi> Heb. 3. 13. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be too late. And as a Bargain of this Nature would be ſtruck up, theſe following Directions may be of Uſe.</p>
                  <p>1. You muſt be content to Go, or (in ſome ſence) to Part with thoſe Wiſe Virgins, whom (heretofore) a Right of walking with (in point of State-Communion) hath been Challenged. Keep with them ſtill, as Precious Friends; but ceaſe from any Higher Claim, or from pretending unto the ſameneſs of your Spiritual Caſe and State with theirs. There is that Maketh himſelf Rich, who yet hath Nothing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 7. and as that Man is not Relieved by another, ſo neither will he work himſelf, till eaſed of that fooliſh Fanſie. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> were not Baptized of <hi>John, Lu.</hi> 7 30. becauſe unwilling to confeſs their ſins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 6, 7, 8. Nor would thoſe Jews come unto Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 5. 40. who boldly called God their Father, <hi>John</hi> 8. 41. no more than Perſons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convinced of their Blindneſs, will Buy Eye-ſalve, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17, 18. Oh let us rather Buy Oyl twice than be without it, from Groundleſs ſelf conceit.</p>
                  <p>2. Set out his Oyl with higheſt Commendations, as to its Virtues, Worth, and Need. Think not to have its Price abated by your ſleighty undervaluings, as in your dealing with other Tradeſmen. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bid See for Love, and Buy for Money; but here, your Money is your Love: Therefore he biddeth moſt for Oyl, who doth moſt
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:50213:98"/> Prize it. Wiſe Virgins Hide their Love from Men, leſt they ſhould elſe be ſleighted by them: But Chriſt's Admirers have learnt the Art of Gaining upon his Affections. Children will Cry for what they would have, and ſo muſt you for Spiritual Knowledge, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Oh that thou wert my Brother,</hi> ſaith ſhe to Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 1. And ſay you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Wiſdom, <hi>Thou art my Siſter,</hi> Prov. 7. 4. <hi>Get <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding with all thy Getting,</hi> Prov. 4. 7. Exalt her, <hi>v.</hi> 8. who Loveth him that Loveth her, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 17. Our Eſtimations, Sighs, and Tears, are Currant Gold with Chriſt, though nothing Valued by other Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                  <p>3. Take heed by any means of Dallying with him. Make not Two words, for Fear of a Denyal. He came no more unto thoſe <hi>Gadarens,</hi> who did but once deſire him to be gone, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 37. nor would he ever after deal with thoſe who had Rejected his firſt Offer, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 24. Were it not to Befriend you, (to Pleaſure You more than Himſelf) he would not Sell it: And Love Deſpiſed is the moſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking. Yea, he who fell not in with <hi>Paul</hi>'s firſt Offer, never deſired more the ſight of that Commodity, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 25. However this Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Loweſt Price is at the firſt, as Late Repentants do Experience, who formerly have Dallied with his Offers: How Cheap did <hi>Lydia</hi> Buy, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 14. Compared with thoſe Second Comers, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. You cannot be without his Oyl, nor doth your Conſcience think it is too Dear; therefore Accept it with Thankſgiving: And when you have it, your having been ſo long without it will be your onely Grief.</p>
                  <p>4. Have Patience though, and do not haſtily fling away: Chriſt deals with none (as an Eventual Seller) but Sober Chapmen. Inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinacy of Deſire is a Luſt which he will not indulge in any: Men ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do not Ask, or Ask amiſs; who therefore have not their Deſire, <hi>James</hi> 4. 2, 3. Your Time is alway ready, ſo is not his, <hi>John</hi> 7. 6. who will not Serve his Mother, till ſuch an Hour, <hi>John</hi> 2. 4. And <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> was made to tarry one week longer, whom nothing elſe would ſerve but Now, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. 13, 14. Thus many poor Creatures want their Oyl, becauſe they cannot wait, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. 33. but fling out of Chriſts Shop (with <hi>Saul)</hi> into the Devil's, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 6, 7. and there are Cheated, <hi>v.</hi> 14. You are but Beggars, in the Form of Buyers; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore demean your ſelves accordingly. And do not Paſſionately retort or turn away, though his firſt Anſwer ſhould be rough; but give good words, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 2, 3. and wait his Leiſure, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 123. 2. whoſe Oyl cannot be had elſe where, and is thus given, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. 14.</p>
                  <p>5. Be ſure you do Deſign it for your ſelves, (next unto him,) and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:50213:98"/> for your own beſt good, as theſe Wiſe Virgins Exhortation hinteth. Expect the firſt Queſtion put (next to What do you lack) will be, Whom is it for? Would you have Oyl, meerly to Boaſt thereof, or to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct another; or onely to Accommodate a Worldly Intereſt? There's other Oyl good enough for ſuch a purpoſe. This Holy Oyl muſt not be put unto a Common Uſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 31. 33. Some would have Healing Oyl, to ſin more freely; and Fragrant Oyl, to gain the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins good Affections; and Lightſome Oyl, to make a ſhew: But Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Oyl is not put into ſuch polluted Veſſels. <hi>Abraham</hi> had more than Ordinary Light, and he was careful to Improve it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 17. 19. And <hi>Paul,</hi> together with his filled Veſſel, had ſomething given to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. And though Grace makes the Change, yet the Indulging of Lower Aims is inconſiſtent with a Grounded Hope of ever Buying it.</p>
                  <p>6. Conſult not with Fleſh and Blood; our own, or others. The Fleſh at beſt (or in a Natural Reſpect) is Weak, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 41. much more in a Moral ſence, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. and therefore Fleſh and Blood can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Inherit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 50. for theſe will never Buy. Dull Fleſh hath no great mind to Go, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 10. Proud Fleſh thinks ſcorn to have the eaſieſt Terms Impoſed, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5. 11. 13. Self-loving Fleſh would part with Nothing, much leſs with All, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 21, 22. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this ſelf (or Fleſh) muſt be Denied, before Chriſt will be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 24. Conſult not herewith in others neither, as <hi>Abſalom</hi> did with <hi>Huſhai,</hi> and <hi>Rehoboam</hi> with his Companions, unto the Ruine of them both. The Serpent will tell thee, Chriſt is too Dear, and may abate, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 4, 5. Relations will bid thee (firſt) to provide for Them: And Carnal Friends will break thine Heart with their Diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſives, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 13. <hi>Peter</hi> took Chriſt to do, for being too forward, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 22. whom therefore <hi>Paul</hi> would not conſult with at the firſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 16, 17, 18. Nor will a Bargain of this Nature be concluded, till ſuch are ſilenced by us, as <hi>Peter</hi> was by Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 23.</p>
                  <p>7. Mind his Commodity before you do Refuſe it; and under this ſingle denomination (here) of its being called Oyl; yea, meerly with Reſpect to that Particular uſe of Oyl intended here, <hi>viz.</hi> its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Serviceable in point of Light; which may induce your Buying of it.</p>
                  <p>1. The Light is ſweet, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11. 7. and doth Rejoyce the Heart, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 30. therefore the Light is put for Joy and Gladneſs, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 8. 16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97. 11. by which the Heart-chearing influence of a Godly Ruler is deſcribed, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 3, 4. Yea, God's own Love (which is the choiſeſt Cordial) is called the Light of his Face or Countenance,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:50213:99"/> 
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 6. Now, would you not be glad of Joy? Come then, yea, come and Buy this Lightſome (and this Gladſome) Oyl. When <hi>Sampſon</hi> had loſt his Eyes (or Light) how did he Grind in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon-Houſe, <hi>Judg.</hi> 16. 21. it may be his Teeth together, in way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation and Vexation, chuſing to be Avenged upon others for his Two Eyes, by Loſing his very Life, <hi>v.</hi> 28. 30. which Now was not Deſirable. Yea, therefore Hell it ſelf is Repreſented by a place of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, where Grinders are, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 12. as Heaven is a place of Light, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 12. and Joy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 11. to ſhew the Pleaſantneſs of Light (as in it ſelf conſidered,) and Dolefulneſs of being in the Dark.</p>
                  <p>2. Light giveth Life and Being unto viſible Objects, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe are as if they were Not, as to our being Solaced with their ſight: Yea, we had better Not to hear of Beauty, than to want Eyes or Light, by which to ſee it. Man ſeeth not (at leaſt not chiefly) by Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, as Owls and ſuch like Creatures do; therefore His very Eyes are uſeleſs, if in the Dark; who onely Heareth, what others See. Death and Deſtruction have heard of Wiſdom, <hi>Job</hi> 28. 22. but ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners know not that Eminent Gift, <hi>John</hi> 4. 10. becauſe there is no Light in them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 20. How marvellouſly would it Affect, could Men but ſee the Amiableneſs of God's Tabernacles, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 1. the many Flowers in <hi>Sion</hi>'s Land, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 12. much more the Glory of God himſelf, as it appeareth in his Sanctuary, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. 2. <hi>John</hi> did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Chriſt's Glory, in his Loweſt ſtate, <hi>John</hi> 1. 14. but others ſaw no Beauty in him, who therefore did Deſpiſe him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 2.</p>
                  <p>3. Elſe will you not have the Comfort of what you do Enjoy. Souls in a ſtate of Darkneſs may Really be Intereſted in Electing Love; but till Chriſt gives them Light, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 14. ſuch cannot know it: without his Holy Enlightning Spirit, there is no Joy of his Salvation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 11, 12. Thou haſt the Scriptures, but till thine Eyes are Opened, thou canſt not underſtand them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. becauſe they are Spiritually to be Diſcerned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. Thou haſt the Tender of that Marvellous Light, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. the Sun of Righteouſneſs doth ſhine upon thee, but yet thy Darkneſs cannot Comprehend it, <hi>John</hi> 1. 5. God is not far from every of you, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 27. yet can you not ſee or know him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Son Revealeth him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 27. therefore ſuch Groundedly cannot Joy, ſave in the Creature. Nor can you ſee the Creature Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo as to Rejoyce therein aright, ſave as this Sun doth make that Moon conſpicuous, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 5, 6. or as God's Light doth ſhew the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of that Inheritance.</p>
                  <p>4. You will not elſe be apt to Bluſh or be Aſhamed, whatever cauſe there may be of it. It is a ſhame to ſpeak of thoſe things which are
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:50213:99"/> done by ſome in ſecret, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 12. becauſe all Manifeſtation is by the Light, <hi>v.</hi> 13. How did Enlightned <hi>Ezra</hi> Bluſh, to mention the ſins of others, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 6. much more to ſtain his own Profeſſion with the leaſt unſeemly Motion, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 8. 22! Light is Subjected in the Eye, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 22. which Eye is therefore apt to water with every Mote, and will not ſuffer ſpots to reſt upon the Garment: Thence is it, that Enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ones are alway Neat. But ſinners are in Darkneſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 16. who therefore cannot be Aſhamed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 15. Sin being Virtually up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Back, where vileſt Spots may be (and be Continued) with utmoſt Confidence, till they ſhall be Aſhamed and Conſounded both together.</p>
                  <p>5. You will not elſe have any Spiritual Heat or Warmth; which alway is Accompanied with Spiritual Light. The Natural Sun may warm him who is Blind, as to his Bodily ſight; but ſo doth not the Sun of Righteouſneſs, ſave whom he alſo doth Enlighten. There may be true Spiritual Light o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This is that Oyl of Joy, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 3. and without which there is no Laughter, ſave what is Mad, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 2. 2. Darkneſs and Sorrow are Co-incident, and both of them are Conſiſtent with the Light of Earthly Sparks, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. 11. All Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms Paths are Paths of Peace, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 17. which is a way that others know not, becauſe their Paths are crooked, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 8. and therefore their Caſe muſt needs be ſad.</p>
                  <p>6. You will not elſe be Spiritually helpful unto others; at leaſt, there is no Promiſe for it upon other Terms, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 22. Chriſt was Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed firſt, and with this Special Oyl; and then his Preaching was Effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 1. but, <hi>What haſt thou to do</hi> (ſaith God unto the Wicked) <hi>to Declare my Statutes,</hi> Pſal. 50. 16? whom others are bid to let alone, and with Reſpect unto their Blindneſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 14.

Since Darkneſs Comprehendeth not this Light, <hi>John</hi> 1. 5.</p>
                  <p>7. You will not elſe be able to prevent your doing Miſchief unto others and your ſelves. <hi>Paul</hi> was Injurious, and yet Ignorant, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. untill he was enlightned from Above, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 3, 4, 5. Nor can
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:50213:100"/> Men (in the Dark) Diſcern, although the Prince of Life be Killed by them, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 15. 17. How will Chriſt's Piercers Mourn when they ſhall ſee him, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. perceiving how they have broken his Commands, by Ruſhing on them; and how they have trod him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Foot? Yea, as to ones ſelf, Wiſe Men (or Virgins ſtored with Oyl) fore-ſee the Evil, and Hide themſelves, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 3. while others Paſs on, as <hi>Balaam</hi> did, upon the Swords point, untill his Eyes were Opened; <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. 31. Thence is it, that ſuch are apt, either to be ſnared, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 15. or elſe to kick againſt the Pricks, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 5. and run upon the Boſſes of God's Buckler, <hi>Job</hi> 15. 26. if not to ſtumble and fall upon that Breaking Rock, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 15. becauſe there is no Light in them, <hi>v.</hi> 20.</p>
                  <p>8. You will not elſe find the way, wherein you ought to Walk; and ſo be ſubject either to ſit ſtill for want of Light, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o go wrong, if not Turn back; or at the leaſt, to walk uncomfortably, and unacceptably, though poſſibly in a Right Path. Darkneſs diſpoſeth more for ſleep than any kind of Action, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 23. which will be ſad for him whoſe Neceſſary work requireth utmoſt ſpeed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 7. And in the dark, Men (if they walk) are apt to Wander, <hi>John</hi> 12. 35. ſave in a broad and Beaten Road, which Chriſt's is not, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 14. Yea, ſuch are prone to wheel about into their bad Old way again, and ſo (being Giddy with frequent Turning) to Fall and Riſe no more. Nay, though by chance ſuch may hit Right, yet are they ſubject to be drawn aſide, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9 15. and though they ſhould go on, yet as it is uncomfortable, ſo they were Superſtitious ſtill, who Worſhipped the True, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known God, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 22, 23.</p>
                  <p>9. You will not elſe Go forth to Meet the Bridegroom, no more than do theſe Fooliſh Virgins for lack of Oyl or Light: and ſo you will not enter with him to the Marriage. Chriſt's Coming is unto <hi>Sion, Iſa.</hi> 59. 20. and <hi>Sion</hi>'s way is Narroweſt at the laſt: Therefore Men (in the Dark) will There be moſt ſubject to Miſtake. This Going forth is a Time-Truth and Duty; and but Two Hundred (of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands) have Underſtanding of the Times, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. 22. therefore without peculiar Light Men are not like to hit this way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The greateſt Robberies (as in the Letter) are Near this City, eſpecially when Travellers are Benighted: Therefore (in ſuch a Caſe) none will ſtir out. And if you Go not forth to Meet him, you will not come with him unto the Marriage, which will be very ſad, as may be made out after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                  <p>10. You will not elſe be fit to hold Communion with the Wiſe; as being Convicted to be Fooliſh Virgins, by wanting Oyl or Light at
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:50213:100"/> ſuch a Time. I wonder how any can imagine that Light and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould Agree, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14. or why they are Offended with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding upon that Account, which is as Old as ſince the firſt Creation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 4. True <hi>Iſraelites</hi> have Light, and in their Dwellings, by which they are Diſtinguiſhed from Dark <hi>Egyptians, Exod.</hi> 10. 23. and not to be enlightned is a ſign of Death, <hi>Job</hi> 33. 30. Nor was the firſt Creation Perfected, (much leſs the Second) ſo long as Darkneſs was upon it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 2. So that both State-Communion with the Wiſe, yea, and Communion with their State, depend upon your having of their Oyl or Light: Nor will you elſe Partake of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in Light, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 12. or Light of Life, <hi>John</hi> 8. 12.</p>

                     </gap>hich was enough to ſilence them, <hi>v.</hi> 3. 3. when their Deſolation came upon them, <hi>v.</hi> 29. Poor <hi>Zedekiah</hi> was content to Hear what <hi>Jeremiah</hi> would ſay unto him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 38. 14. but was afraid of being ſeen (by others) in that Shop, <hi>v.</hi> 24. nor did he Buy. Thus might theſe Fooliſh Virgins Pray for Light, but with Diſſimulation, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 42. 20. or ſtumbling-blocks ſet before their Faces, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 3.</p>
                  <p>2. Affirmatively: Their going to Buy doth rather ſeem to intimate their ſtaying otherwhere, (under a falſe Diſguiſe) till ſuch a Time.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Till that Practice, of Going out (to Meet the Bridegroom) is grown more General among Profeſſors. I am perſwaded this is the Caſe of many, who have no mind to ſee the Light of a Command, till they ſhall have the Light of Company. When divers Torches are abroad, ſome Men Delight to walk at ſuch a Time, and ſpare the Coſt of Buying for themſelves: But ſingle Lights are not ſufficient to guide Dim-ſighted Hypocrites in Narrow ways. When Chriſt himſelf was left alone, then <hi>Peter</hi> did not ſeem to know him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 74. untill the Miſt before his Eyes was (by a Beaming Look from Chriſt) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into a ſhower, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 61, 62. but if Sobriety be the Faſhion, a flanting Courtier will be Sober, (though meerly indeed for Faſhions-ſake;) and if Chriſt's Way be once a Common Road, then Fooliſh Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins have Bought their Oyl, or want no Light.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Till it be ſafer walking in ſuch a way. Darkneſs is ſometimes put for outward Danger, and Light for Safety, <hi>Job</hi> 29. 3. Nor hath a Fooliſh Virgin Light in the way of Duty untill its Danger is Removed. A Godly Man is ſometimes Tempted to ſit ſtill, at ſuch a Time, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 1. but yet (Habitually) he is a God-like Man, to whom the Night ſhineth as the Day, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 12. nor doth he ſtumble in his way of Duty, although it may Expoſe him unto Danger, <hi>John</hi> 11. 8, 9. But Sufferings are the ſinners Onely (Apprehended) Darkneſs; who therefore cannot ſee their way untill that Cloud be Taken up, which giveth Light to all True <hi>Iſraelites, Exod.</hi> 14. 20. So long as thoſe were in a ſtrait or Viſible Danger, they Hid themſelves in Caves and Thickets, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 6. in Mount <hi>Ephraim,</hi> untill the Enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to Run, and then they alſo had Light enough to follow hard after, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 21.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Till Goers out to Meet the Bridegroom are ſeen (by them) to be Rewarded; or to Go in with him unto the Marriage. Great is the Light of Earthly Recompences; the Expectation whereof made pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blind
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:50213:101"/> 
                     <hi>Judas</hi> hit the way to Chriſt, untill he miſſed of them, and then he Loſt his way again, <hi>John</hi> 12. 6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 14. How ſtrongly did <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi>'s Wages make him ſee that way, the Dangerouſneſs whereof was Obvious unto an Aſſe's Eye, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. 23. and therefore a ſinners way ſeems Right unto himſelf, although its End is Death, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 12. This Recompence of Reward enlightned <hi>Moſes</hi> into the way of Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Duty, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 25, 26. and when the Bridegroom's Favours are beſtowed upon his Followers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 28. that Glory will Diſcover others having Gone aſide; who will not then want Light, (had they but Leave and Time) for their Returning; till when, they do Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of Darkneſs.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Untill ſome Greater (Apprehended) Danger doth Accompany their ſitting ſtill, than was in going forth to Meet the Bridegroom. The Old Heavens ſhall paſs away with a great Noiſe, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 10. which may Awaken theſe Fooliſh Virgins out of their Loytering ſlumber, and ſo may give them Light. The Clapping of Chriſt's Door (when it is ſhut by him in Anger) may ſtartle all that are without, and make them Run, to be Admitted in, who formerly Pretended Ignorance, as to their Going out When Houſes are on Fire, then Blindeſt Sluggards will have Light ſufficient into that way, wherein a Lion (formerly) was ſaid to be, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 13.

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. Why doth not Chriſt ſtay untill the Fooliſh Virgins do Return?</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Becauſe his own ſet time was fully come, beyond which 'tis not fit that he ſhould Tarry for any ſort of Perſons whatſoever. Himſelf is Ready, ſo is the Bride; yea, all the Wiſe Virgins alſo: And can it be Expected then, that he ſhould Tarry for ſome few Fooliſh Loyterers? He lately had Engaged for his Speedy coming, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 6. and Mercy muſt give way to Truth; yea, All his Name (or At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes) unto his Word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138. 2. The five Wiſe Virgins are for his Preſent Coming; and though the other five would have him ſtay, yet ſhall not he Then have a Caſting Voice, upon his own Account? If Time and Tide will ſtay for none; much leſs will their Creator: Eſpecially ſince his Preſent Coming is with State; and Earthly Kings will ſcorn to Tarry till ſluggiſh Servants get them ready.</p>
                  <p>2. Becauſe he elſe might Tarry long enough, or rather, Not come at all, if not untill theſe Virgins have bought Oyl: Therefore that can be no Let unto him. As Oyl is put for Special Grace, ſo Fooliſh Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins (in that Day) will never Buy it, (as their Excluſion Evidenceth;) nor as 'tis put for Spiritual Light into this Duty, of Going out to meet the Bridegroom. Nor will they have Light into the Matter of that work before his Coming; becauſe their Light is wholly Borrowed from that which followeth upon his being Come. Now, if he muſt come before they will have Oyl, then if he means to come at all, he muſt not ſtay for them. They will have him come firſt, with reference to their Enlightning Motives; therefore he will not Tarry for them, although by that means they are ſhut out for ever.</p>
                  <p>3. Becauſe the time of ſhewing Mercy (unto ſuch, and in ſome ſence) is Now Expired. The Attribute of Mercy is inſeparable from God's Eſſence, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 6. yet is its Exerciſe Commanded by his Will, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 18. And though he Delighteth in that Exerciſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9. 24. yet hath he Bounded it by ſuch a time, beyond which time he will no more have Mercy, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1. 6. Now, when the Seventh Trumpet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to Sound, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 7. then Time ſhall be no longer, <hi>v.</hi> 6. and partly in this Reſpect, for that contemporizes with the ſhutting of this Door. Theſe Virgins are Dead before that Time; and though Chriſt is ſo Civil, as to wait a while, yet when their being Dead is out of Doubt, (as now it is) he then will ſtay no longer. His Patient Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit will not alway ſtrive with ſinful Man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 3. but hath its Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits ſet by him, who can make way for Anger, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 50.</p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:50213:104"/>
                  <p> 4. Becauſe they have had Warning, Means, and Time enough. What could they Reaſonably deſire more? They had the Scriptures from the firſt, which ſhew the worth and Need of Oyl: And 'tis but the Fanſie of ſome in Hell, that other Applications would be more Effectual, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 31. They had the Benefit of Converſing with the wiſe, by whom Chriſt worketh Now, as if Himſelf were preſent, <hi>John</hi> 14. 12. At their firſt Going forth they ſhould have taken Oyl with them: And Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in the firſt Concoction are not wont to be Corrected in the Second. They had been wakened by the Cry; and Repetitions ſeldom profit them who are not benefited by the Preacher's Voice, <hi>John</hi> 9. 27. They did confeſs their want of Oyl, and made a ſhew of going to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it, but did not Act accordingly; and ſo had nothing to Object againſt the Juſtneſs of Chriſt's being wearied with ſuch kind of Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyers.</p>
                  <p>5. Becauſe they are not worth the waiting for. They onely ſtood in need of beeing Buryed, for which Chriſt will not ſtay at all, ſince he would not have others do ſo, upon that Account, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 22. They ſeem to be Mad, or Fools in Grain; and if an <hi>Achiſh</hi> had no need of ſuch, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 15. much leſs hath Chriſt, ſo as to Tarry for them, they had ſufficiently Deſpiſed him, by diſregarding all his counſel, who therefore are not worthy to be ſo much Honoured by him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30. They did but cheat the other Virgins all this while with flattering words; And therefore neither Chriſt nor They would be Abuſed by them any longer. Nor would they ever have been good for ought, in caſe they ſhould have come by being tarried for; therefore Chriſt might deſign their being turned off by Coming, while they were Parted from the VVife.</p>
                  <p>6. Becauſe he elſe would miſs of his Main Purpoſe; which is, to Caſt ſome out for ever, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 12. by coming on them unawares, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 34, 35. An Abſolute Decree of ſome Men's ſad Excluſion, is eaſily conſiſtent with a preſent (viſible) Poſſibility of their Admiſſion; both which are hinted in thoſe words, <hi>The Children of the Kingdom ſhall be caſt out,</hi> Mat. 8. 12. And though Chriſt hath enough for All, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 4. yet but a Remnant onely ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 27.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The ſame <hi>Greek</hi> word doth elſewhere ſignifie, Fore-Ordained; and is Tranſlated (in that ſence) Prepared, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 34. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 16. and thus it is here partly meant, with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto the Perſons Intereſted in this Priviledge, of Going to the Marriage. Such as were Ordained to Eternal Life, ('tis ſaid) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 48. and none (hereafter) will be Glorified, ſave they who (through fore-knowledge) were of Old Predeſtinated, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. All are Invited, but none will come, ſave whom the Father draweth, <hi>John</hi> 6. 44. or who are Given by him to the Son, <hi>John</hi> 17. 2. Thoſe muſt Expect to be put by, whoſe Names cannot be found upon Record, when Ancient Regiſters will be enquired into, <hi>Ezra</hi> 2. 62. Let us therefore make our Calling and Election ſure; Election by our Calling, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. and This, by adding unto Faith all other Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, <hi>v.</hi> 5. and in Abundance, <hi>v.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>2. The ſame word alſo elſe-where ſignifies a Thing, or Perſons being Purely Ordered (or Prepared) by the Lord himſelf; and in a way of ſingular Diſcrimination. Thus ſitting at Chriſt's Right Hand and his Left, is ſaid to be Prepared (or made <hi>Ready)</hi> by the Father, for ſome Perſons above others, though of the ſame kind with them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 23. And thus <hi>[They that were Ready]</hi> may Import, thoſe whom the Father hath peculiarly Deſigned hereunto, Above their Fellows, who (in their Day) may poſſibly have drank as Deeply of Chriſt's Bitter Cup as theſe. This lays the Duſt of ſelf-conceit in any, who are Admitted to the Marriage; and will Occaſion their Crying, Grace, Grace, at ſuch a time, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 7. This is of Uſe to Moderate our over-earneſt Expectations and Deſires of ſharing in that ſpecial Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge: And this doth Eminently Declare, that Fooliſh Virgins ſhall never Enter; ſince many Wiſe ones will not be ſuffered to ſee that day, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 17.</p>
                  <p>3. The word (here uſed) doth moſt commonly Import One's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prepared for ſuch a work, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 21. or in a preſent Readineſs to ſet about it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 6. And in a Three-fold ſence.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. With Reſpect unto a Perſon's Will. Thus <hi>Peter</hi> was Ready to go with Chriſt to Priſon, in point of preſent (Apprehended) Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 23. And <hi>Paul</hi> was Ready, not onely to be Bound, but alſo to Die for the Name of Jeſus, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 13. And thus, None but the Wiſe Virgins were (at preſent) willing to go with Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Marriage; ſince whoſoever will, may freely Drink thoſe Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Waters, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17. The Fooliſh Virgins were Habitually
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:50213:105"/> willing, as is evinced by their Coming afterwards: But yet not Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; for then they would have made more Haſte. They had a ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh will, but not Induſtrious, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 4. untill the Summers Heat was over, which is the onely Time for Harveſt-work. They had a will unto the Place, but not unto the way that led thereunto: And ſuch are ſaid to have no will for Life, <hi>John</hi> 5. 40. which yet All do Deſire.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. VVith reference unto a Perſon's Freedom otherways, or having Nothing elſe to Do. Thus were the Jews Ready to have killed <hi>Paul,</hi> and waited onely for an Opportunity, <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 21. Thus alſo are the wiſe Virgins Ready, at ſuch a Time, as having laid aſide all other bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, (or being at a Moments warning,) and onely waiting for their Lord's Appearing, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>6. But Fooliſh Virgins are not yet at Leiſure. How long will it be, before a Sluggard thinks it time to Riſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 9, 10? And when the Drunkard doth Awake, he yet will at the ſame work again, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 35. <hi>To Morrow ſhall be as this Day</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and more Abundant,</hi> Iſa. 56. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. VVith reference unto a Perſons Fitneſs (every way) for ſuch an Undertaking. Thus Saints are bid to be alway Ready to give an Anſwer to every Man, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. that is, to be Prepared for it. And in this ſence it is here Chiefly meant.</p>
                  <p>VVhich kind of Readineſs (for the Bridegroom's coming) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1. Sobriety is Required, with reference unto the Near approaching End, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 7. ſuch as this Diſpenſation is. Thus are we to be So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in our Speech, not being vain or over-talkative: In our Behaviour, not being Light or Indiſcreet: In uſing the Creature, not Exceeding our Eſtate or Comelineſs: In worldly Employments, not being Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous or C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thus are we to be very Sober, both as to our Inward Frame, and Outward ſhew.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such muſt not have their Oyl to Buy; as Oyl importeth Special
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:50213:105"/> Grace, or Spiritual Light into their Preſent Duty. For want hereof, the Fooliſh Virgins are ſhut out, as being not Ready. There is Oyl to be had, juſt till that Time; but when the Bridegroom cometh, his Shop is (for a while) ſhut up; as it will be, for Ever, at his laſt Coming, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 11. How ſhould this Quicken, to Improve the Preſent Reſpite; eſpecially, ſince future Converting Grace is like to be the Portion of the <hi>Gentiles, Mal.</hi> 1. 11. or another ſort of Perſons. And Light into the Preſent work (of Going out to meet the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom) is here Particularly meant by Oyl; as that which is Expreſly Requiſite, and without which, the Having of Grace will hardly be made out. Were this Believed, how would it ſtartle ſome, who make light of their being (yet) in the Dark.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Such muſt have gone forth a Second time to Meet him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Bridegroom Tarried, becauſe the Wiſe Virgins were not Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (then) in that Reſpect. They had (indeed) Gone out Before; but Chriſt Now comes in Kingly State: And King <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> had his Virgins Doubly Purified, ſix Moneths with Oyl of Myrth, and other ſix Moneths with Odours, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 2. 12. Thoſe never will be Ready to go in with Chriſt, who are contented with a Separation from more Groſs Pollutions. Men uſe to paſs through ſeveral Rooms before they come into the Preſence Chamber: Nor can it be Expected, that a Child's Firſt Coat ſhould ever ſuit a Manly Growing Diſpenſation. If we believe that all theſe things ſhall be Diſſolved, <hi>What manner of Perſons ſhould we be,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 11? Or with what Face can we ſuppoſe, that Nothing more ſhould be required Now, than what hath ſormerly been done by us?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Such muſt have Mourned over all their former failings; and not content themſelves with bare Reforming. Chriſt cometh with the Clouds, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 7. and we muſt Go with Rain, or Weeping, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 9. as for an onely Son, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. Covering our ſelves with ſhame, for we have ſinned, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 25. and ſad Bemoaning for our Evil ways, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 18, 19. Yea, and this Mourning muſt be Apart, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 12, 13. with reference unto Secret faults, and Freedom for an Holy Roaring, and as an Evidence of our being upright. And as a Proof hereof, our former Idols muſt be caſt away with Deteſtation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 22. Yea, we muſt Bear God's Indignation, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 9. Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as the Puniſhment of our Iniquity, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 40, 41. and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the ſins of others onely. There are yet few Reformers, but fewer Mourners between the Porch and Altar, <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 17. and yet till then, we are not Ready for Chriſt's wiping at his Wedding, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 2. 4.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Such muſt be Holily Reſolved (in the ſtrength of God) to be
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:50213:106"/> more Faithful to him for the time to come. Though other Lords may have been owned by us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 13. though other helps have been confided in, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 23. yet ſhall it be ſo no more, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 3. Some are more Open for Chriſt, than heretofore; who yet will promiſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if a freſh Temptation cometh: Theſe are not Ready, they want the Girdle of an Holy Reſolution; nor will they confeſs a former ſin. But we muſt joyn our ſelves unto the Lord in a Perpetual Covenant, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 5. or be One Spirit with Chriſt, which joyning to him doth Import, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17. Bound in the Spirit, as <hi>Paul</hi> was, whatever might befall him, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 22. Thus he that Loſeth his Life, ſhall ſave it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 25. and none will Reign with Chriſt on Earth, ſave they who are thus (virtually at leaſt) beheaded for him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 4. or are full Followers of him, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 24.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Such muſt be made up of Earneſt Wreſtling, and patient Wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which is a Rare Conjunction, at ſuch a time. Some may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to wait, but from the want of Holy Earneſtneſs, or from a ſinful Indifferency and ſlightineſs of Spirit, Relating unto ſuch a Mercy; as is evinced by their Negligent Uſe of Sanctified Means. Others are Earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt enough, but yet unable to VVait, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. 33. Ready to Give up all, if not Relieved by ſuch a time, as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 3. But where ſhall we find a ſilent Cryer, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 15? A Submiſſive pleader, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12. 1? Or Lawful Striver, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5? Yet are we not fit to Drink till very Thirſty, and yet duly Cool: till furniſh'd with a Spirit of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. and yet willing to wait, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 17. <hi>Micah</hi> 7. 7.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Such muſt be able to Bear the Manner of Chriſt's Appearing, which will be very ſtrange; and therefore Bleſſed will they be, who are not then Offended in him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 6. He will Come in the Night, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 15. and ſome will therefore think he means to Steal, or take by Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; wherewith weak ones will be Offended: as in a Spiritual caſe, the ſuddenneſs of a Convincing word makes ſome poor Creatures the more Averſe. His Coming will be Terrible; and therewith Children will be Offended; as ſome poor Childiſh Creatures are with Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Calls unto Repentance. His firſt Appearance will be ſmall, and therewith ſome will be Offended, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 10. as <hi>Judas</hi> was, and others are, becauſe Chriſt's Preſent Pay is moſtly Spiritual. And therefore Bleſſed is the people who know his Joyful ſound, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 15.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Such (now) muſt be upon their conſtant VVatch; who former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, perhaps, had been Aſleep. Chriſt here concludeth with that Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:50213:108"/> therefore they hinder the Lamb's Marriage, who could be ſatisfied with <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s work.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Princes are wont to Marry (firſt) by Proxies; or by ſome other Perſons Repreſenting them, and ſo doth Chriſt. He was an Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band unto <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Jer. 31. 32. yet were they Married (firſt) to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> being Baptized into him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2.

Chriſt hath a Throne (or Kingdom) of his own, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 21. which Diſpenſation (at the laſt) is called his Bride, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 2. with reference unto his Perſonal Marrying of it: But yet this King will Honour ſome of his Saints, by letting Them Marry that Miniſtration firſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149. 9. that he might firſt Sup with Them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 20. thence all Dominions ('tis ſaid) ſhall Serve and Obey Him, when yet his People (chiefly) do Poſſeſs the Kingdom, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 27.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Marriage Creates the Neareſt Union, and fulleſt Communication, or moſt ſweet Communion. So is it here, ſince Chriſt will then Reſt in his Love, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 17. or Center in a ſweet Deportment towards All, but more eſpecially his Choſen ones, whom he will then Evidence his Conjugal Affection unto, his Everlaſting kindneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 8. Affected with their former Sufferings from others, <hi>Zech.</hi> 1. 15. and from Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 2. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 20.

Paying their Debts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 34, 35. 40. and deeply Revenging all their Injuries, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. A Marriage cannot be, unleſs the Bride and Bridegroom be there Preſent, at leaſt-wiſe in their Repreſentatives. Thus Chriſt was Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent when he firſt Married <hi>Iſrael, Acts</hi> 7. 38. thus it is alſo from the Preſence of his Spirit (in an Inſtrument) if any Soul be Married to him, or Diſcipled, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20. and when his Kingly ſtate ſhall be ſet up, its Name will be, <hi>The Lord is there,</hi> Ezek. 48. 35. His Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal preſence is reſerved till the Laſt; but yet the Bridegroom will Now come, elſe could there not be a Marriage. Prepare for his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing then, ſo as that Saints ſhall ſay, <hi>Loe, This is He,</hi> Iſa. 25. 9. Yea, others then will Look upon him, either with weeping Eyes, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. or with ſelf-hiding from his Face, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 16. His ſpiritual Preſence hath been ſuſpended; but he will come again, in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, to fill the ſecond Temple with his Glory, and Conſtitute a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Marriage.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Increaſe is wont to follow upon Marriage, in way of Bleſſing
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:50213:108"/> from the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 28. ſo doth it upon Chriſt's. Thus <hi>Iſrael</hi> Multiplyed more than others after her being Married unto Chriſt, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5. 7. unto the Aggravating of her Adultery. Thus alſo, Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Saints are therefore Married unto Chriſt, that ſo they might be Fruitful unto God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 4. and it was fore-told, that Gentile-Saints ſhould Multiply more (in point of Number) than did the Ancient Jewiſh Wife, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 1. And when Chriſt ſhall be further Married to his Kingly Diſpenſation, <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> will be ſown with the Seed of Man, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 27. they ſhall be Increaſed like a Flock, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 37. unto their own Admiration <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 21. and Place ſhall not be found for them, <hi>Zech.</hi> 10. 10. The Children that <hi>Sion</hi> will then have, ſhall call for Place wherein to Dwell, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 20.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Marriage is during Life, ſince God hates Putting away, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 16. ſave in the caſe of Adultery, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 32. therefore to have been the Wife or Husband of more than one, (by Reaſon of unmeet Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce) is ſuch a ſcandal, as incapacitateth for a Goſpel Church-Office, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2. 12. and for the Place of a Widow, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 9. Thus Chriſt's Betrothing is for ever, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 19. whoſe Marriage-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Particular Souls doth undertake for their being Loyal to him, who therefore Never will be Divorced, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 40. And though Chriſt Now Diſowns the Jews (his Ancient Wife) <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 2. yet did ſhe firſt play the Harlot, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 32. as the Bill of her Divorce will Evidence, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. 1. Nor will he put away his Wife, as to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile-ſtate, till they prove Falſe to him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 22. nor ever alter his Married Diſpenſation (with them, or with the Converted Jews) but upon their Departing from him firſt.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Marriage doth not Neceſſitate the Husband's Conſtant Preſence though; but is conſiſtent with his (ſometime) Diſcontinuance, unto the Bride-Chamber-Children's Mourning, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 15. though Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots are Glad thereof, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 18, 19. Particular Souls Experience this, unto their ſorrow; though as the Fruit of their Apoſtacy, as in Relation to the preſent Jews, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 1. or Senſuality, as in the days of <hi>Conſtantine, Cant.</hi> 5. 2. or ſad Formality, as after the Return of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi>'s Old Captivity, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 1. according unto <hi>Brightman</hi>'s Caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe ſeveral Times. And with Reſpect unto Chriſt's Marrying with his Diſpenſation; ſome think his Second Perſonal Coming will be Diſcontinued: Though I am not of that Opinion, ſince Saints will then be ever with the Lord, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 17. But yet, his Glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, with Reſtored Gentile-Saints (if not the Jews) will be (I think) but for a Time; to make Room for his After-coming, to wit, in Perſon.</p>
                  <p n="11">
                     <pb n="212" facs="tcp:50213:109"/> 11. Marriages of Old were Solemnized in ſuch a way; wherein Chriſt's Union with his Diſpenſation doth Reſemble Marriage. As thus,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It was moſt Honourable, that a Marriage ſhould be known; and ſo is Chriſt's Coming (as a Bridegroom) Notified here before hand, for all the World to ſpeak, if they have ought againſt it. He never uſed to ſteal a Marriage, by Creeping into Houſes, as Suſpitious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons do, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 6. but publiſhed his Purpoſe unto <hi>Pharaoh, Exod.</hi> 5. 1. and the King of <hi>Babylon, Jer.</hi> 51. 61. Thus was his Perſonal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Publiſhed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 2. and 3. 3. thus is his Spiritual Kingdom to be managed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 27. thus was his Temporal Kingdom firſt ſet up, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 4, 5. and thus (I am perſwaded) it will be Reſtored, as in the Type, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2, 7.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Marriage is a time of more than Ordinary Joy to all there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as well as to the Bride and Bridegroom; which is of Uſe ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews, as faith <hi>Buxtorfius, Synag. Juda.</hi> Therefore the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Sun is Repreſented by a Bridegroom's Coming out of his Tent or Chamber, with others Joyful Acclamations, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 5. And thus <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> (who was the Bridegroom's Friend) Rejoyced greatly, becauſe of the Bridegroom's Voice, <hi>John</hi> 3. 29. And as there is Joy in Heaven, upon a Souls Marrying unto Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 10. ſo doth it make thoſe Glad on Earth who are that Bridegroom's Friends, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 23. And thus Chriſt's Coming here, will be Received with many ſhoutings, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 7. and all kind of Muſick, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 2, 3. and holy Dancing, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 13. And as the Bride hath cauſe to Joy (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conſidering what a Match this is) ſo Chriſt will then Rejoyce as doth a Bridegroom, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62. 5. whoſe Heart is then moſt Glad, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 11.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Marriage alſo is a Time of Feaſting; eſpecially when Kings are Married, as when <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> Married <hi>Eſther, Eſth.</hi> 2. 18. for which ſome Poor (no doubt) might fare the better. Thus <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s firſt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was called a Feaſt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. 1. in which regard, their Flocks and Herds muſt all go with them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10. 9. And therefore God's mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Feaſt for Chriſt (in Goſpel-times) is called a Marriage, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 2. And as that Publican made a Feaſt, upon his being Married un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 29. So will Chriſt make a Feaſt of Wines and Fat things full of Marrow, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25. 6. when he ſhall come, <hi>v.</hi> 9. as when he firſt came in Perſon, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 2. and when his Temporal Kingdom was firſt ſet up, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 1. according unto <hi>Brightman</hi>'s Notion. And he who bids the Poor to be then called, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 13. will then Relieve the Pooreſt Creatures with ſome of his Servants broken Meats; yea, all the People, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25. 6.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="213" facs="tcp:50213:109"/> 4. Much Company is wont to be at all Marriages; ſo will there be at ſuch a time. When Souls are Married unto Chriſt, the Angels flock to ſee Repenting Sinners, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 10: So when the Church in <hi>Corinth</hi> was Eſpouſed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2, the Angels came to their Solemnities, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 10. How great a mixed Multitude there was, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 38, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was Eſpouſed in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 2: and when Chriſt wedded his Diſpenſation in Goſpel-times, his Chariots were twenty thouſand, even Thouſands of Angels, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 17. Thus in the days of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> we read of an innumerable Multitude, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 9; and a great Voice of <hi>much</hi> People afterwards, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 1, together with the Fall of <hi>Babylon, verſ.</hi> 2. Then All will gather themſelves to <hi>Sion, Iſa.</hi> 60. 4; as all the City did to <hi>Naomi,</hi> at her Return, <hi>Ruth</hi> 1. 19: and whoſe Thundering Voices will evince the Second Temple's being open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 19.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. All ſorts of perſons <hi>(Then)</hi> are in their greateſt Bravery; ſo is it at Chriſt's Marriage. Then <hi>Solomon</hi> is crowned with a ſtately Crown, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 11. The Bride is brought, in Cloathing of wrought Gold and Needle-work, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 13, 14. yea God will Then appear in Glorious Greatneſs, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 13. as Earthly Parents are moſt fine upon their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Wedding-day.

                  <p n="6">6. Marriage-Solemnities (of Old) were in the Night; which Chriſt doth here allude unto; And ſo are all his Marriages. He married <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> (at leaſt-wiſe call'd them to be married) in the Night, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 42: and Married (or Betrothed) Souls are called out of Darkneſs, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. and in the Night he will come as a Bridegroom, in this Parable. He was Betrayed in the Night, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23; and in the Night will he Return.

Chriſts Kingdom cometh not with Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; therefore Not in the Day; but as the Lightning, which ſhineth out of Darkneſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 17: 20. 24. This ſheweth His Affection to that Diſpenſation; and will trie who love ſleep above it. It will be a Night of Rioting unto the Wicked, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 7. and Sorrow to the Saints,

                  <p>7. Bridegrooms are wont to be Met (of Old) and ſo to be conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Marriage; which alſo Chriſt requireth here.

                  <p>2. Becauſe the Glory of this Latter Houſe (or Diſpenſation) will be Greater than of the Former, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 9. Now when the New Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and Earth ſhall be created, the former ſhall not be remembred, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 17. Chriſt Married (at the firſt) when he was Young, (as ſome Great Perſons uſe to doe.) Who, (in relation to his Spiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, when it was firſt ſet up,) was Therefore call'd a Child, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 27. and a Man-child, with reference unto the firſt Erecting of his Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Kingdom, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 5. both which muſt needs be Myſtically under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. Now Infant-Marriage is not taken notice of, when one is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Afterwards at his full Age, as Chriſt is at this time; from whence the Name of Marriage therefore (ever after) doth Commence. This ſecond (alſo) will Eclipſe the former, becauſe the Glory of Chriſts Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Temporal Kingdom (Now) will be united, which Heretofore were ſevered. Now as Chriſts ancient Marriage with the <hi>Jews,</hi> was to be quite forgot in Goſpel-times, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 16; ſo will his Second Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with the Gentiles, quite Deſtroy the former, by reaſon of that Glory which Excelleth, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 10: therefore this Latter onely hath that Name.</p>

                     </gap> other upon Earth; yet doth he not Take it, in the ſecond ſence, till his Returning from having taken it in the former. And in like manner, he may be ſaid to have been Married <hi>[Firſt,]</hi> in Heaven, when he Aſcended, (ſince Marrying and Receiving are the ſame;) and yet he doth not Take (or Marry that Diſpenſation upon Earth, till his Returning from that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Wedding. And ſo, his Knocking <hi>(Luke</hi> 12. 36.) muſt onely intimate his ſudden Coming, conſiſtent with a going out to meet him.</p>
                  <p>2. By altering the Tranſlation of that <hi>Greek</hi> word <hi>['Ex]</hi> which is there rendred <hi>From, Lu.</hi> 12. 36; but yet it may be read <hi>[by reaſon of]</hi> and ſo that Place and this will nothing differ, although fore-named Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances

And in that ſence Chriſts coming <hi>[To]</hi> the Marriage here, and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning (in <hi>Luke)</hi> by reaſon of the Wedding, may well agree; ſince his Return, <hi>(viz.</hi> from Heaven,) will be <hi>[becauſe of]</hi> his Wedding upon Earth. Nor need we ſtick at the word <hi>Return,</hi> if we referre it unto Heaven, which He is now Gone into, who ſometime was on Earth; eſpecially ſince his Marrying is ſo Deſireable, as that Earth therefore may be call'd his Home; and ſo his Coming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (for ſuch a purpoſe) may well be call'd <hi>Returning,</hi> in the ſtricteſt ſence; yet doth the <hi>Greek</hi> word onely note <hi>Removing.</hi>

In which laſt ſence, Chriſt doth compare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (in <hi>Luke)</hi> unto an Houſholder, who taketh liberty (Himſelf) to Feaſt abroad, or to be at another's Wedding in the Night; yet doth he expect, his Servants ſhould be well employ'd at home, and ready to Open at his firſt Knock. Chriſt is Now Feaſting upon his Fathers Throne, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 21; yet will he have his Servants (upon Earth,) to <hi>watch,</hi> that when he ſhall Return from thence, (which in regard of Feaſting is call'd a Wedding,) unto his proper Marriage here, they might immediately receive him.

                  <p>9. Such then will be Diſcharged from any kind of Future Toyling whatever.

Thence is that ſtate Deſcribed, by their conſtant ſinging, and ſitting at a Feaſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 13, 14. and yet by ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God (in his Temple) Day and Night, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 15. becauſe that Service (then) will be their Meat and Drink, or Matter of Delight; not ſaying (as thoſe of Old) <hi>When will the New Moon be Gone, Amos</hi> 8. 5? But, <hi>Let us Go ſpeedily to Pray before the Lord, Zech.</hi> 8. 21.</p>
                  <p>10. Such will have the Comfort of each others Company.

Yea, theſe Wiſe Virgins then will be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from the Fooliſh, as Sheep from Goats, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 32. no ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger uncircumciſed in Heart ſhall enter (with <hi>Iſrael)</hi> into the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 9. but <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be Holy, <hi>Joel</hi> 3. 17.</p>
                  <p>11. Such then will there continue, none being Caſt out, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 13. but he that wants his Wedding Garment, <hi>v.</hi> 12. which ſhews the Poſſibility of ſome Hypocrites creeping then in, as heretofore, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 4. But Sons will abide in that Houſe for Ever, <hi>John</hi> 8. 35. and Faithful Overcomers will be as Pillars in God's Temple, who ſhall no more Go out, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 12. Indeed God's People (in the General) will from that time be no more termed forſaken, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62. 4. nor will they have any more to do with Groſs Idolatry, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 3. which yet may be conſiſtent with their Gradual declining in the General, till Chriſt himſelf ſhall come in Perſon, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 13.

Yea, ſuch will Grow, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 5. paſſing with Chriſt from one Room to another; and reaping the Benefit of that Increaſing Diſpenſation, all their Time.</p>
                  <p>12. All this will then be Accented unto the Saints, by their Peculiar ſharing in it; or by the quite contrary Portion of the Generality at ſuch a Time. Darkneſs ſhall cover the Earth, when <hi>Sion</hi>'s Light will Riſe upon the Saints, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. 1, 2. when Chriſt ſhall bid <hi>[Theſe]</hi> Come, in Order unto intimate Communion with himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 34.

Thus was <hi>Nehemiah</hi> Tempted to Meet ſome others in the Temple, with its Doors ſhut upon them, but would not yield thereunto, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 6. 10, 11. thus did thoſe Angels (Lawfully) pull <hi>Lot</hi> in, and ſhut the Door againſt thoſe wicked and Miſcievous <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, Gen.</hi> 19. 10. And ſo it may be here. Admitted Virgins ſhall not Depart, for Chriſt hath ſhut them In: Nor ſhall any Enter, to do them Hurt, for he hath ſhut them Out. Thus <hi>Sion</hi> ſhall no more be. made to Drink the Cup of Trembling, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51. 22. her uncircumciſed Enemies ſhall no more come in to her, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 1.

                  <p> 2. The Fooliſh Virgins onely (and not the Wiſe) are ſaid to Goe, or Leave the Others Company: which is Obſervable. The Name of <hi>Separation</hi> hath been alway Infamous, although the Scripture clearly Owns it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14. but at this Day the Fooliſh Virgins are the Separatiſts, however Apt to charge it upon others. There hath been formerly, a Lawfull (Proper) Separation made by Saints, from Others: as when the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Way was ſeparated from, by thoſe <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 8. who ſometime were Obliged to walk therein. But yet, Backſliders (Returning to their Ancient Duty) cannot ſo Properly be ſaid to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from their bad Companions, ſince there was never any Lawfull Union, and ſo no need of a Divorce. However, the preſent caſe is Plain: the Fooliſh Virgins ſeparate from the Wiſe, as to their former Joynt Practice, of Going out to meet the Bridegroom. Let no man therefore Check wiſe Virgins by that Name, which is not Theirs, nor (Abſolutely) Infamous.</p>
                  <p>3. It is here ſaid, <hi>They went to Buy,</hi> who (as it hath been Proved) went to <hi>Sleep:</hi> from whence is hinted, that ſinfull Actions are Covered over with fair Pretences; and more Eſpecially in theſe Latter dayes. Herein conſiſteth much of that Deceitfulneſs which lurketh: in the Heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 9. and Sin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 13. Thus bold Complyers are termed Wiſe in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 10: and Wantonneſs is called Love, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 18. yea, Perſecution is counted Wiſdom, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. 10, Zeal, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 6. and Duty, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 9. Some men Declare their Sin, as did <hi>Lots</hi> eldeſt Daughter, (having learnt that in <hi>Sodom, Iſa.</hi> 3. 9.) in call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her inceſtuous infant, <hi>Moab,</hi> which ſignifieth, <hi>Of her Father,</hi> Gen. 19, 37: but Others are more ſubtile, ſuch are the Fooliſh Virgins. Conſcience (in ſuch) will not permit a full Profeſſion: and as That would have crackt their Credit quite, ſo would it have ſtopt their mouths from ever Claiming a Right of Entring afterwards.</p>
                  <p>4. Their falſe Hypocriſie is not Detected, (by any Word Diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it,) but as they did Pretend <hi>[to goe and Buy]</hi> ſo is it here Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They did profeſs ('tis like) this was their End: and Eminent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors are not Haſtily charged with Lying. However, Chriſt may (yet) let it paſs for Currant: to Harden them in their (undiſcovered) Sin: to learn us Moderation in a Diſputable Caſe: and to Reſerve their Manifeſtation till his Coming, unto the Heightning of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, by ſhutting them out, who (till that time) were not Convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: or, by their being Apprehended, Tryed and Executed all at Once. Methinks I ſee the Reaſon here, of ſome mens Confident ſelf-juſtifying; of others unaccuſtomed forbearing them in way of Cenſures, and of God's Ordering it to be ſo: Others will be more fully ſatisfied, when
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:50213:115"/> they ſhall ſee that following ſudden Revelation of God's righteous Judgement at the Bridegrooms Coming.</p>
                  <p>5. Deceitfull Shews will not Advantage in this Day of Chriſt; ſince he will Come, while Fooliſh Virgins are gone to Buy, (as they Diſſemblingly pretend) unto their being ſhut out for Ever. Some may ſeek Deep to hide their Counſel from the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 15. but this ſhall be eſteemed as the Potters Clay: for ſhall not their Creator know, <hi>v.</hi> 16? He ſearcheth the Heart, to give to every Man his Due, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 10. Therefore Ought got unjuſtly, will not Proſper, <hi>v.</hi> 11: and this the Churches (or Profeſſors) ſhall be made to Know, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 23. Yea, when it is thus, in point of Turning things upſide down, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 16. within a very little while, the Lord will turn ſuch ſeeming fruitfull Field, (or Glorious Hypocrites) into a Forreſt, <hi>v.</hi> 17. Thoſe do but Haſten his Appearing to their ſhame, who ſeek to cover evil Actions with fair Diſguiſes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 5. as Chriſt Then cometh here, upon the Fooliſh Virgins, for our Warning.</p>
                  <p>6. Peculiar Service (done for Chriſt) will ſuitably be Rewarded (by him) upon Earth, ſince all the Wiſe Virgins will be Admitted to the Marriage. Then Chriſt will gird himſelf, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 37. and ſerve them: his Feaſt of Wines, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25. 6. will make them to forget their former Miſery, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 7.

When apt to faint (by reaſon of ſome Wilderneſs-temptations) in fleeing out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> let this <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> come into our Mind, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51. 50. or what God hath Prepared for him that waiteth for him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. 4. Then will their Fooliſhneſs appear, who have deſired to be Excuſed from this Supper, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 18. when they ſhall ſee, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 28. how Bleſſed a thing it is to have been Called thereunto, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 9. the Truth whereof is ſignified there, by its being ordered to be Writ, and by a ſuperadded Teſtimony.</p>
                  <p>7. This Feaſt may not be Taſted though, untill the Bridegroom's Coming; ſince theſe wiſe Virgins are here ſaid to goe <hi>[with Him]</hi> unto the Marriage. We therefore have need of Patience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 36: yea therefore Chriſt may put his Knife unto our Throat (or Exerciſe us with Delays) becauſe we are ſo given to Appetite, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 2.

                  <p>8. There is a Readineſs required for this Feaſt; and without which, none are Admitted to the Marriage. Some kind of Duty is Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately incumbent on us, while in the Gall of Bitterneſs, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 22, 23; but yet All (proper) Priviledges have their Fitneſs pre-required. We muſt be wrought for Glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5: nor will the Blind and Lame, (or Men defective mainly in their Light and Walking) ever Enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>David</hi>'s Houſe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 8. Though Duty is required, apart from Priviledge; yet Priviledges may not be Expected without ſuitable Duty. Indeed, this Marriage will be as Burdenſome to Unready Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as ſuch themſelves will be to Chriſt and his Companions; as Heaven it ſelf would be an Hell to Sinners. And uppermoſt Seats will be Reſerved for the greateſt Gallants in that Day; or ſhe ſhall ſtand at Chriſt's Right-hand, whoſe Clothing is the Gold of <hi>Ophir, Pſalm.</hi> 45. 9.</p>
                  <p>9. The Marriage-Feaſt (at ſuch a Time) will be in ſome Place which hath (as it were) a Door; as its being <hi>[ſhut]</hi> importeth. All may be Invited thither, but none will <hi>ſhare</hi> therein (as Gueſts) ſave they who are Admitted with Approbation. This will be a peculiar Priviledge; which they ſhall know, whoſe Careleſneſs (in point of fore-required Duty) will Exclude them. The <hi>New Jeruſalems</hi> Gates ſhall not be ſhut at all, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 25; to ſhew the Abſoluteneſs of its Security: yet will there be Angels ſtanding at them, <hi>v.</hi> 12, to keep thoſe Out who have no Right to Enter, <hi>v.</hi> 27. ſo will it be Now. And as there ſhall be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Keepers of the Sanctuary then, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 16; ſo Carefull <hi>Eliakim</hi> will have the Key of <hi>David</hi>'s Houſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22. 22; by Means whereof, Communion-Acts (relating unto Priviledge as well as Duty) will be ſecured.</p>
                  <p>10. The Door of Mercy will (in ſome ſence, and unto ſome) be ſhut on Earth; or in this leſſer Day of Judgement. It is (Inſenſibly) ſo at Preſent, unto particular Souls, as to Chriſt's ſtriving with them by his Spirit of Grace: but it will Then be ſo more Evidently, in point of Priviledges; yea, though ſome (at that time) will ſeek to Enter, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 24. Nor will it be to be Wondred at, ſince all the (Intended) Gueſts will be then Come, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And as there will be no ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of that high Wall, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 12; nor ſtrength to force a paſſage through this Door: ſo neither will late-got Oyl or Tears be able to ſhoot its Lock for Ever.

                  <p>11. It therefore highly doth concern the Virgins or Profeſſors of our Days to get themſelves Ready as faſt as may be. And in the Preſſing whereof, I ſhall content my ſelf with urging hereunto, as that word <hi>[Ready]</hi> appertaineth unto Virgins in the Letter; and as the ſame <hi>Greek</hi> word is uſed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 7. with reference unto the Bride at ſuch a time. In Order unto the ſetting home of which Exhortation, theſe following Motives may be of Uſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mot.</hi> 1. This getting Ready is that Great work of Time incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on us, which therefore had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>d be chiefly minded by us alway, and much more Now. What is required of the Bride, but to be Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 7? What of each Gueſt? but to have on his Wedding-Garment, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 12? Yea, what doth God require, from firſt to laſt, but to Put off Old former Cloaths, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 22. and that we Put on New, <hi>v.</hi> 24? The onely thing required of Spouſes (by their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band at this Feaſt) will be, to make themſelves as Fine as may be; as once a Perſon told his Lady, upon a like Occaſion. Nor came we (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) into this World to Eat and Drink, or Buy and Sell; but to get Ready for our Change. Earth is a Trimming place for Heaven, and Time ſhould be Employed for Eternity. He that is Ready in this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſence, hath done the work belonging to his Day. Therefore we cannot be too Early up at ſuch a work.</p>
                  <p>2. It is the Property of Virgins to be ſelf-adorning; <hi>Can-Maids for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their Ornaments,</hi> Jer. 2. 32? Such kind of forgetfulneſs ſeemeth to be inconſiſtent with thir ſtate; next to their being termed Harlots, ſuch cannot bear to be Reproached with their want of Neatneſs; whom if we Differ from (in this Reſpect) as to their Nature, how can we take it ill, not to be called by their Name? Harlots of Old were to be known by ſome particular kind of Vail, <hi>Gen.</hi> 38. 14. and Spiritual Sluttiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſuch a Vail or Covering which ſheweth Perſons to be no Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins. All ſorts of Profeſſors therefore have diſowned their Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as they have ſeen them to be careleſs in their Habit, Compared with their Fellows. So that Remiſneſs in our Holy ſelf-adorning will very much Darken the viſibility of our being Virgins or Profeſſors, and Hazard the Total Loſs of our Repute.</p>

                  <p>5. Thus ſhall we have more Love and Honour from Chriſt and others. How very plain are ſome in their Night Habit; yea, how did <hi>Michal</hi> Deſpiſe her Husband <hi>David,</hi> when he was ſtripped of his ſtately Robes, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 20.

Thus ſhall we alſo be more Amiable in the Eyes of others; both Saints and Sinners. VVhen <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> ſhall be Neat, or Clean from their Defilements, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 27. 23. then will they Unite in Love, <hi>v.</hi> 19. and be no more Divided, <hi>v.</hi> 22. Yea, Carnal Creatures will then Reſpect us, if not Love us; ſuch being apt to honour others, meerly becauſe of their Apparel, whom otherwiſe they do not much Regard.</p>
                  <p>6. God will be Glorified in us by this means, which is a ſelf-ſufficient Motive to get Ready. Saints Dreſs themſelves and Chriſt at once; as their unhandſomneſs diſgraceth him, whom they call Husband. Their Change of Raiment ſhews the fulneſs of his Wardrobe; their waſhed
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:50213:117"/> Robes, the rinſing Virtue of his Blood; their Curioſity, his Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Purity, and Greatneſs. The comely ſitting of each piece in its due place, doth Evidence the Trueneſs of his Glaſs, <hi>viz.</hi> the Scriptures; yea, every freſh Addition makes them look more like to Chriſt, Grace being his very Image, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10. and therefore ſelf-adorning Saints are ſaid to put on Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 14. And thus will Chriſt be Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in our Bodies, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 20. as God was Manifeſted in Chriſt's Fleſh, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. becauſe the Father's Glory was to be ſeen in him, <hi>John</hi> 1. 14. as His in Us, when we are Ready.</p>
                  <p>7. Thus ſhall we be more uſeful (at the Preſent) unto others, with whom we do converſe; which is a Motive (ſtrong enough) to make us Haſten. All are more apt to mind Examples, than a Rule: Although God's Law was ſtill the ſame, yet when there was no King (or Judge) in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to put that Law in Practice, then every one did what ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good unto him, <hi>Judg.</hi> 17. 6.

                  <p>8. Elſe ſhall we ill Requite his Love, in Tarrying all this while, for ſuch a purpoſe. Chriſt is Affectionate, unto the Height: who did Exceedingly Deſire to eat his Laſt (or Death-importing) Paſſeover, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 15. much more to ſee this Wedding day, as ever did a Youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Bridegroom, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62. 5. whoſe waiting therefore, is like that of a Dropſie Man for Drink, which Exerciſeth Patience to the utmoſt. Now, as he partly tarrieth, untill the Vintage <hi>(viz.</hi> the wicked) be fully Ripe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 18. So more eſpecially, untill the Wheat (or Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt) be ſo, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 30. or till the Bride be Ready, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 7. whoſe Readineſs conſiſteth (Mainly) in the Readineſs of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. And if for our Expediency, he Tarrieth Now, as he did ſometime (therefore) Go away, <hi>John</hi> 16. 7. ſhall we then Trifle?

                  <p>9. Thus ſhall we haſten (what in us lieth) the Coming of this day of God, which is a Duty, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 12. and that which All (in words) Deſire, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 1. And as we are to Haſten it by our Prayer, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:50213:118"/> 7. ſo (more eſpecially) by our getting Ready, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 13. elſe ſhall we not Compleatly Haſten it. As Chriſt is therefore ſlack, to Evidence his willingneſs, that none ſhould Periſh, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9. ſo is he purpoſed to Wait untill his Precious ones be Ready; as he could not Deſtroy the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> till <hi>Lot</hi> was come to <hi>Zoar, Gen.</hi> 19. 22. ſo will he now do for his Servants ſake, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 8. But if his Jewels were all made up, ſuch would not then be faulted for his ſtaying: Till when, Chriſt's Spirit in them (whilſt they are Praying for his Coming) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but Tax them, as being the Cauſe, why he yet cannot Come: And it will be exceeding ſad, if we ſhall be thus Acceſſary to our own and others Miſery.</p>
                  <p>10. Thus will his Coming be more Comfortable to us, than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe can be expected. Chriſt in his People, is the Hope of Glory, as to the Groundedneſs of ſuch an Hope, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 27. and is its ſweetneſs alſo, ſince all Delight ariſeth from the Union or Conjunction of things ſuitable each to other.

Whereas that Day will be Confounding unto others, <hi>Amos</hi> 5. 18. who then will be afraid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. 14.

                  <p>11. Elſe will it be (at leaſt) unto our Loſs, ſo far as Chriſt will then be fain to Dreſs us, or to make up (by his laſt Inſtantaneous Change) wherein our ſelves were careleſly Defective. 'Tis true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Chriſt will have all his People Ready then, becauſe Himſelf will Cloath them with His Change of Raiment, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 4. yet doth it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them to be Doing what they can, ſince their Reward will then be ſuited to their own Labour, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 8. Saints will then Differ each from other, in point of Glory, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 44. as at Chriſt's Perſonal Coming, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 41, 42. which Difference will ariſe from hence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome will have Laboured more, in getting Ready, whilſt others have been ſleeping, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 40. 43, 44.

                  <p>12. Thus ſhall we (at Preſent) have the Comfort of our being
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:50213:118"/> Ready, as it is in it ſelf conſidered, and with Reſpect unto our ſelves.

Yea, ſelf-adorning Virgins are ſo apt to be in Love with their Attire, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 32. as not to ſlumber at ſuch a Time, becauſe of ſelf-beholding and ſelf-pleaſing Fancies then at work.

And wilt thou Caſt us out, unto the Devil and his Angels, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 41? To which it will be then Replyed, but did you not All this unto your ſelves, <hi>Zech.</hi> 7. 5. 6? And in a Deceitful way of keeping back your Male, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 14? Both as to principal Time-Truths and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. You have had your Reward already, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 2. and ſelfiſh Aims have made your work Iniquity, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 23.</p>
                  <p>4. Becauſe they did go forth (at firſt) to meet the Bridegroom, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 1. Lord (may ſuch plead) we ſometimes bore an Open Teſtimony, hazarding our All in the Maintaining of thy Cauſe: and doth not Half the work Deſerve ſome Part of Pay? But Chriſt will then Reply, you did run well, who hindred you, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 7? Why did you not ſo run, as to Obtain, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 24? My Croſs ſhould daily have been taken up, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 23. nor was Salvation promiſed, but to Endurers to the End, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 13. You were the more Fooliſh to Begin, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 28. yea, I was therefore moſt Reproached by you Apoſtates, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 6. however, you knew the Law, that all the Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlider's former Righteouſneſs ſhall be forgotten, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 24.</p>
                  <p>5. Becauſe their Not going out (the Second time) proceeded from their want of Oyl, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 8. Lord (will theſe ſay) we had not Light unto this Latter work, and wilt thou Gather where thou haſt not Strewed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 24? Heathens will not be Judged for the Light they Have not, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 12. and ſhall we Virgins be more Hardly dealt with? Our Lamps went out, through lack of Oyl, and therefore muſt we now be caſt out into utter Darkneſs? But Chriſt will then Reply, you took no Oyl at firſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 3. whoſe Fault was that? You truſted unto flaſhy good Affections, though I had told you of the ſtony Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 20, 21. Nay, the Truth is, you wanted not Light, but

                  <p>6. Becauſe of what they had more Lately done, or ſince the Cry was made. Lord, (will they ſay) we preſently Aroſe and Trimmed our Lamps, as well as our Companions; and is that nothing worth?

To which it will be Anſwered, You did my work Deceitfully; and that Deſerves a Curſe, inſtead of VVages, <hi>Jer.</hi> 48. 10. You beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged coldly at the beſt; that Taught my Servants to Deny you, as 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5. 18, 19. Nor did you come to Buy of Me; I know you not, 'tis ſo long ſince I ſaw you.</p>
                  <p>7. Becauſe of their not having yet had a Legal Trial, or due Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction before a Sentence. Lord (will theſe ſay,) Thy Servants Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally have not Born Witneſs (Hitherto) againſt us; ask them, and they will not deny it: Nor was the Caſe decided (fully) in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences unto this Day: Shall we now be Condemned (by our Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) before a Trial? Or Excommunicated without a Previous Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition? But Chriſt will Anſwer, You heard the Cry, as your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakening thereupon Evinced: You had the Scriptures, clearing up that Duty, wherein you failed: You alſo had ſome Pangs of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, witneſs the Trimming of your Lamps: Therefore you had a Three-fold Admonition, which is one more than Neceſſary, <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 10.</p>
                  <p>8. Becauſe they have Now Got that Oyl (as their Returning inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth) which heretofore they lacked. Lord (will theſe ſay,) we Now are come up to Thy Terms: We Now have Light into that work of Going Forth: And wilt thou not Admit Repenting ſinners, yea, at what Time ſoever? But Chriſt may Anſwer, Your Common-Prayer-Book hath it <hi>[at what Time ſoever]</hi> but not the Scripture; nay, I have oft told you, that my Door will not ſtand alway Open. Nor have you now got Light into your Duty; but onely wit to ſave your Intereſt, by falling in with ſafe and Gainful Service. And if I ſhould forgive you this time alſo, the next Temptation would evince your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill the ſame, as hath been oft Experimented.</p>
                  <p>9. Becauſe of what Encouragement they ſometimes had to Hope, as to a Real work of Grace upon their Hearts, (and conſequent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Hath not thy Spirit witneſſed with ours, that we were Thine? Yea, had we not the witneſs of water, as well as Blood, of Duty (Excepting this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular)
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:50213:124"/> as well as Faith on Thee? And ſhall this one Blot ſpoil our former Evidences? But Chriſt will Anſwer, I never Warranted your Thus concluding: You ſpoke Peace to your ſelves, and Fathered it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me. I gave you Sixpence, and you thence hoped to be mine Heirs. Time-Duties (alſo) are that by which all other is to be Tried, <hi>John</hi> 8. 24.</p>
                  <p>10. Becauſe of ſome Admitted in, who were as likely as Themſelves (or rather more) to be Excluded. Lord (will theſe ſay,) There ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth one, who is too Young, to have Deſerved ſuch a Priviledge; let him give Place to us his Seniors: Here comes Another, who hath been formerly on Old <hi>Egyptian,</hi> ſhall he ſtep in before us <hi>Iſraelites?</hi> Yea, thoſe Wiſe Virgins there (our Old Companions) have had but a very little Time, wherein to ſhew their being Better than our ſelves; why then are we ſo hardly dealt with? But Chriſt will Anſwer, How Bold are you, thus to Reply, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 20. or Bind my Hand, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 15? Theſe few Wiſe Virgins came in Time, ſo did not you: Thoſe Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ones have not been Tried, as you have been: However, I have told you, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 11, 12. that many ſhall be Admitted, (yea, ſome <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> and <hi>Aſſyrians, Iſa.</hi> 19. 23.) when ſuch as you ſhall be Caſt out.</p>
                  <p>11. Conſidering the Matter of their Requeſt. Lord (will theſe ſay) did we Deſire a Diſpenſation to Tranſgreſs, or did we onely beg ſome outward Mercy, then might we Juſtly be Repulſed: But we In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat Communion with thy ſelf, and with thy People; and haſt thou not Promiſed to give thy Spirit (or Spiritual Good things) to them that ask him, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 13? But Chriſt will Anſwer, That Promiſe is onely made to Children: And Promiſes are onely ſure in Me, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20. whom they who are without, are therefore Strangers from the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12. ſave as the Spirit is Promiſed unto ſuch as do Return at my Reproof, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 23. Nor do you ſo much deſire Communion with my People, as with their Priviledges.</p>
                  <p>12. Conſidering the Earneſtneſs of their Deſire; which doth evince their being Cordial and Affectionate. Lord (will theſe ſay, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Job</hi> did to his Friends) Look upon us, for it is evident, if we Lie, <hi>Job</hi> 6. 28. Our Coming, and our Pleading intimate that we are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>13. Conſidering the Manner of their preſent Supplication. Lord (will theſe ſay) we do not offer to Enforce a Paſſage, but onely ſtand here knocking at the Door: Nor do we call to others, but do deſire of Thee, to be Admitted with thy Leave: Nor do we Claim it as our Right, but Humbly Beg it as a Favour. To which it will be Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, You know 'tis but a Folly (Now) to be Diſorderſy, as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, elſe is your Spirit ſtill the ſame. The Gates of Hell cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt this Door, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 18. Nor will the preſent Porters Open without mine Order, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 9. and as your Caſe will not permit a Claim, ſo neither will your Conſcience ſuffer it; yea, Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt alone doth make you (in Appearance) Humble.</p>
                  <p>14. Conſidering the Ingenuouſneſs of their Profeſſion; imported by that Title <hi>[Lord]</hi> which they Now give to Chriſt. Lord (will theſe ſay,) we Now acknowledge thee to be our Lord: We do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Subjection to thy Laws: Nor ſhall we henceforth Diſobey thee, onely this once forgive our ſin, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> Pleaded, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10. 17. But Chriſt will Anſwer, <hi>Not every one that ſaith, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into this Heavenly Kingdom, but he that doth my Father</hi>'s <hi>Will,</hi> Mat. 7. 21. Nor are you better than your Predeceſſors, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 9. who did but Flatter with their Mouth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 36. and Haſten their Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Hypocriſie, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 13, 14. all which befell them for Enſample, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 11. However Now, the Door is ſhut.</p>
                  <p>15. Conſidering his Graciouſneſs, whom they have Now to Argue with. Lord (will theſe ſay at their Laſt plea,) we do confeſs thy So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty; but canſt thou not evince that, in a way of Mercy, if thou pleaſeſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 18? Is not thy Grace Deſigned for Supremacy in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-times, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 6? And will Chriſt fall therefrom at Laſt? How can the ſhutting of thy Door upon us conſiſt with having no Pleaſure in our Death, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 11. or thy Delight in ſhewing Mercy, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 18? But Chriſt will Anſwer, My Tarrying for you all this while doth witneſs the Truth of what you ſay; but Grace hath had its Time, and I have other Attributes to ſhew the Glory of. However, the Door is ſhut; my word is paſt, which muſt be Magnified more than Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Grace, or any other Syllable of my Name, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138. 2.

He doth not know them, as he did <hi>Abraham,</hi> by having made a Trial of their Holy Fear, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 12. or by his having ever known a Practice ſuitable to this Profeſſion. Nor is it to be wondred at, they are ſo altered (Now) from what they ſometimes were, at their firſt going out; and it is ſo long ſince he ever ſaw them, or hath Heard of them till Now.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

Reprobate Silver ſhall Men call them, becauſe the Lord will then Reject them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 30. Their beſt Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances will (then) not be allowed of, but will be called Iniquity, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 23.

                  <p n="3">3. He will not know them, ſo as to Love them: As they who Love not, do not know the Lord, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 8. or as his Sheep are known by Laying down his Life for them, <hi>John</hi> 10. 14, 15. He will not have any ſpecial favour for them, as for others, who will be in his Books, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 5.

                  <p n="2">2. Their Preſent failing is not Circumſtantial, but very High as to its Matter.

This Parable cannot ſo Properly be Applyed (as it is by ſome) unto Chriſt's Perſonal Coming; ſince there will then be no ſuch room for Fooliſh Virgins Pleading with him, as Here they doe. Then will the Earth, and All therein be burnt up with Material Fire, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 10: excepting ſome few, as in the Ark of Old, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 20. and None of which will then come Afterwards (as doe theſe Fooliſh Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins) untill Chriſt's Reign is Ended, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 5. ſo that we either muſt refer this to ſome other coming, or offer violence unto the Proper Meaning of theſe words. Whereas his Coming with the ſeventh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets ſounding, will fairly admit of ſuch a Parley, and Preſently upon his being come, as is here ſignified. Yet I exclude not his Laſt come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (wholly) from a ſhare herein, ſo far as it is Capable thereof, or without ſtraining.</p>
                  <p>2. Poor Fooliſh Virgins will not Come, untill the Door be ſhut: but then ſuch may be looked for. This will be the righteous Wages of Carnal Prudence: Thus he that ſeeketh to ſave, ſhall Looſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 25. Chriſt hath fore-told it here, that none might be Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 1. and therefore will their Caſe be ſad who Tarry for the Other Virgins company. This doth confirm mine Old Perſwaſion, that few profeſſing <hi>Jews</hi> will find this way untill it be too Late, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 14. But then ſuch will Return, with Open Mouths, unto a Door that will be ſhut againſt them. I ſee what Haſte poor Muck-wet Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures made unto the Ark, when God had once ſhut <hi>Noah</hi> in; <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 16. and how thoſe Eight ſecured Souls did then Rejoyce, whileſt Others were ſoon waſht away.</p>
                  <p>3. Thoſe may know Chriſt, and give him Goodly Words, yea ſeek to Enter; whom yet He will not Know, nor Open unto. Some kind of Knowledge doth not Edifie, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 1. <hi>Dives</hi> in Hell Knew <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> but not to his Advantage, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 23. to ſhew how far unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Notions may Accompany. Such alſo (then) will be for ſmoother Language, not Daring to Inſult, as Heretofore; prepare for Flattery, which yet will not Prevail. Yea ſuch will be Diſſatisfied in their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:50213:128"/> from the Wiſer Virgins, earneſtly Deſiring to Build with them, as <hi>Ezra</hi> 4. 2. but will be ſhamefully Repulſed, as they were, <hi>v.</hi> 3. and yet will not be Able (then) to do the Other any Miſchief, as of Old, <hi>v.</hi> 4. for fear of that Decree and Curſe at ſuch a Time, <hi>Ezra</hi> 6. 8. 11, 12.</p>
                  <p>4. Chriſt is not All made up of Mercy, as ſome poor Creatures fanſie; but Can (yea, Will) give Terrible words, and unto Virgins as well as Others. He ſometimes was a Patient Lion; but he will be a Roaring Lamb: Yea he was alway for an Intermixture of Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings with Encouragements. I am Offended with ſome mens Humours, who are Afraid to give one Cutting word unto this Rotten-hearted Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Profeſſors, and have obſerved what hath been the fruit of Dawbing with untempered Morter. But this will Aggravate Chriſt's Rougher ſpeaking at the laſt: and it will then appear, how far himſelf is Bound (from the Neceſſity of his Nature) to be Gracious. Chriſt onely now Reſerveth Anger, <hi>Nah.</hi> 1. 2. which therefore at the Laſt will turn into the Plague, or when the Vials ſhall be poured forth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>5. Chriſt will then have the Laſt word, in Diſcourſe; as is here ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by their not Replying to his Anſwer. Thus will himſelf be Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, as was <hi>Job,</hi> when After his words they did not ſpeak Again, <hi>Job</hi> 29. 22. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> were oft wont to Prate, untill Chriſt put a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to them concerning his being <hi>David</hi>'s Lord, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 45. and then 'tis ſaid, they neither could Anſwer him, nor durſt they Ask him any more Queſtions, <hi>v.</hi> 46. to ſignifie how Silencing that God-like King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly State will be, when it ſhall be Advanced.

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. Why doth Chriſt call himſelf the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto his Coming in theſe Latter-dayes?</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. To declare his being ſtill a Man, though now Aſcended; and that his Coming (at the Laſt) will be in the Humane Nature al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Some would ſain have him turn'd into a Spirit; though he that is now Aſcended, is alſo He who firſt Deſcended into the Grave, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 10. which is not Applicable to the Spirit of Man, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 3. 21. Others will grant him (as a Man) to be Aſcended, but not that he will <hi>(ſo)</hi> Return; and yet 'tis ſaid, He ſhall <hi>ſo Come,</hi> and in <hi>like Manner,</hi> as he was ſeen to goe, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 11. And though his Coming (in this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) will mainly be in a Myſtical ſence; yet will it be the coming of the Son of Man, though not his coming As a Man (or in his Perſon, till Afterwards (ſave as ſome Man (or Men) may Repreſent him Now, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did of Old, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>2. To ſhew the Nature of his Kingly Diſpenſation (at ſuch a time) in point of Viſibility and Temporality; which is moſt Aptly ſhaddow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out by his (then) coming As the Son of Man. His Eccleſiaſtical and Spiritual Kingdom was ſet up at firſt: beſides both which he had Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kingdom Then, though it was not Immediately to Appear, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 11; which therefore muſt be Temporal. Now that which is meerly Spiritual, is fitlyeſt reſembled by the Soul; as Chriſt (with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference unto his ſpiritual Kingdom) is called the Shepherd of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Souls, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 25. but that which is Temporal, by the Man. Thus <hi>David</hi>'s Temporal Rule was over Men, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 3. and as Chriſt (at his Perſonal coming) is called a Man, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 31. ſo with reſpect
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:50213:129"/> unto the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> coming before that time, this Man ('tis ſaid) ſhall be the Peace, <hi>Mic.</hi> 5. 5.</p>
                  <p>3. To ſhew the Greatneſs of his Humility. He was God's Equal upon Earth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6; and he (as Man) is far above the Angels Now, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 13; yet doth he ſtyle himſelf the Son of Man. He will Then have that Name <hi>[the King of Kings]</hi> upon his Thigh, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 16; but in his Mouth, the Son of Man, which is a Worm, <hi>Job</hi> 25. 6. Thus was <hi>Ezekiel</hi> oft-times called, to make him Humble; and thus Chriſt did as often call himſelf, to ſhew, that he is ſo. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> was come into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> they kept no more the Feaſt of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles, (or the Memorial of their former Low Condition,) till <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi>'s time, but Then it was revived, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 17. which Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation was a Type of this: And when that ſelf-abaſing Feaſt ſhall My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically be Obſerved in theſe latter dayes, then ſhall men thereby know, that Verily the Son of Man is come.</p>
                  <p>4. To hint (perhaps) the Meanneſs of his Firſt appearing in theſe Latter dayes; according to the Conſtant Purport of that Phraſe, <hi>[the Son of Man,]</hi> yea with reſpect to Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 6. That as Himſelf, who Truely was the Son of Man, is onely ſaid to have been Like him Afterwards, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 13. (he is ſo Altered (Now) from what he (ſometime) was:) ſo will it be, with reference to his Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He will (at Laſt) come, as the Son of Man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 30; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Whole of his Own Perſonal Reign will be but Mean, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the Father's Kingdom Afterwards, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 28. And ſo may his Precurſory coming here, be fitly called, that of the Son of Man, becauſe it will be Mean, compared with his Perſonal, when he ſhall Gloriouſly appear as God, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 13. or in the Glory of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 27.</p>
                  <p>5. To ſignifie (perhaps) the great Humanity, or Familiarity of his Converſing with the Sons of Men (excepting ſome) at his Appearing. His Enemies indeed will be then Burnt up round about, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97. 3. but yet his Anger will ceaſe in their Deſtruction, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10. 25. and he will then Reſt in his Love, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 17.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe of the full Reſemblance that is between them, as may be thus made out.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. With reſpect unto the Signs of Both. Chriſt's Perſonal Coming will be notified by many Signs, both in the Sun, and Moon, and Stars, and Earth, and Sea, and Powers of Heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 25, 26: ſo will This Coming be, We have had wonderfull ſigns of ſuch a Nature (and in the Letter) of Later years; though we Now ſee them not, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 74. 9. And in the Myſtery yet more Abundantly. The Scriptures (fitly anſwering to the Sun, or Fountain of Created Light) have been extreamly Darkned, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 29; and more eſpecially ſome Part thereof. And that which Borroweth its Light from thence (or Moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Preaching) hath been turn'd into Blood, as <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 31. at leaſt not given her Light, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 29. Church-Officers are called Stars, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 20; and theſe have ſadly fallen, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 29; at leaſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn their ſhining, <hi>Joel</hi> 3. 15. The Earth (or Civil State of things) hath oft-times Quaked. The Sea (or Many Waters) denoteth People, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 15; whoſe Waves have roared. The Powers of Heaven alſo, (or of the Churches) have been ſhaken.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. With reference unto the ſtate of things Immediately foregoing Both. <hi>Elijah</hi> muſt goe before the Coming of that Great and Terrible Day, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 5. and ſuch a Meſſenger muſt Prepare Chriſt's way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Temple, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 1; ſomething Like unto which our Eyes have ſeen. Chriſt's Perſonal Coming will be uſhered in with great Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and all manner of Wickedneſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 29: ſo will his Preſent coming be; by means of Hypocritical Profeſſors firſt, and the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> afterwards, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10. 5, 6. Yet will all ſorts of ſinners, <hi>Then,</hi> be Careleſs or ſecure, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 3. ſo will they Now, both in <hi>Jeruſalem, Iſa.</hi> 32. 9. and in the Iſles of <hi>Magog, Ezek.</hi> 39. 6. But they will Then be Generally deſtroyed, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 10. ſo will they Now, as by an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, Immediately foregoing it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 13, 15.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. With reference unto the Manner of both theſe Comings. His Perſonal coming will be with the Laſt Trump of all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 52: and This will be with the Laſt Trump of ſeven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 15. That coming will be with a Glorious Train of Saints and Angels, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 7. 10. and ſo will This with a Glorious Change of Church-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4. 3, 4. and Church-Officers, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 4, 5. who are oft-times called Angels. That coming will be on a ſudden, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 3: and ſo will This, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 3. and 11. 14. That Coming will be with Clouds, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 30. and ſo will This, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97. 2. both in the Letter and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:50213:130"/> Myſtery. That Coming will be with a ſhout, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 16. and wail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 7. juſt ſo will This, with reference unto a Diverſe ſort of Perſons then, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 17, 18. and 18, 19, 20.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. VVith reference to the Effects (and Principal Deſigned Ends) of both. He will <hi>[Then]</hi> raiſe the Dead, <hi>John</hi> 5. 28, 29. So will he <hi>[Now]</hi> Revive his VVork, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 2. and People, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 19. as to their Joy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85. 6. He will <hi>[Then]</hi> Reign, and all his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants with him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 4. So will he <hi>[Now] Rev.</hi> 11. 15. 17. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Ancients Gloriouſly, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24. 23. He will <hi>[Then]</hi> Judge the Quick and Dead at his Appearing, or at his Kingdom, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. So will he Now, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 18. He will then Bind the Devil, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 2. and Satan will be Rebuked by him Now, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 2. whoſe wrath (a little before) will therefore be the Greater, as of Old, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 12. That Perſonal Coming will bring Reſt unto the Saints, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 7. and ſo will This, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10. 27. and 33. 20.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. VVith reference to what will follow both a long while after their Beginning. Chriſt's Perſonal Reign will be a Thouſand Years, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 4. and This Dominion is (in ſome Reſpect) for Ever, or Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 27. That Coming will Eſtabliſh All, in their Reſpective preſent ſtates, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 11. and ſo will This, as to the Generality of Old Profeſſors, <hi>viz.</hi> the VViſe and Fooliſh Virgins, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 10. But Satan will be Looſed Then at Laſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 7, 8. So will he Now, as is Apparent from his being Bound (a little after) for a longer Time, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 2. And as there will be <hi>[Then]</hi> a further Reſurrection, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 12. ſo will the Literal Jews be Now Converted, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 12. or Raiſed from the Dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 15. And as Chriſt's Perſonal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <hi>[then]</hi> will be given up unto the Father, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24. So will the Saints Dominion <hi>[Now]</hi> be given up unto the Son.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. With reference unto the ſignal Property of both, <hi>viz.</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment of that very Time, wherein they will begin: which (in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to them Both) is here aſſerted, and other-where, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74. 9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 36. 42. <hi>Mark</hi> 13. 33. 35. 32. This ladeth me to the Next Enquiry.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="question">
                  <head>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. What is the Meaning of theſe words, <hi>Ye know not that Day or Hour?</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It cannot be Denied, but that the Apoſtles themſelves are Primarily intended (here) by that word, <hi>Ye,</hi> whom Chriſt Direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this ſpeech unto, in Anſwer to their fore-going Queſtions, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 3. Now, theſe Apoſtles were very Ignorant, in that particular; yea, notwithſtanding what Chriſt had Newly ſaid: As is apparent, both from his Preſent Affirmation of it Here, and from their Queſtion afterwards, implying their ſudden Expectation of it, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 6. Whoſe
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:50213:130"/> being Ignorant thereof at ſuch a Time, may yet conſiſt with their more clearly knowing it afterwards, and Others alſo, or ſince <hi>John</hi> had his Revelations, and the Spirit's giving forth. <hi>John</hi> 16. 13. yet were Theſe (in Their Day) concerned to Watch, though onely with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto the Near approaching Ruine of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which was an Emblem of Chriſt's Coming, which <hi>John</hi> Lived to ſee, <hi>John</hi> 21. 22. and which are therefore intermingled, both in the Diſciples Queſtion, and Chriſt's Anſwer, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 7. 12. 20. 24, 25. 27. 32.</p>
                  <p>2. By this word <hi>[Ye]</hi> may be intended the Generality of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples afterwards, as is Evinced by Chriſt's ſaying, <hi>John</hi> 13. 10. <hi>Ye are clean,</hi> (that is, Generally) but not All, that is, excepting <hi>Judas</hi> in Particular. And ſo this may import the General Ignorance (of ſuch a Myſtery) among Profeſſors in following times, which yet may be conſiſtent with a Clearer Diſcovery thereof to ſome Particular Perſons; and more eſpecially towards the End. Thus none of the Wicked (at ſuch a time) ſhall Underſtand, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 10. but all the Viſion will be (to ſuch) a ſealed Book, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 20. 11. ſo that no Man or Counſellor will Anſwer a word, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41. 28. But yet the Wiſe ſhall Underſtand, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 10. and there will be ſome Firſt (or Chief one) with Good Tiding of that Kind, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 21. 27.</p>
                  <p>3. This may be Univerſally Interpreted: and ſo, No Man doth Know.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When Chriſt's Perſonal Coming will be, nor yet the Angels, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 35. neither the Son of Man himſelf, <hi>Mark</hi> 13. 32. Which Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Coming is not wholly (here) to be Excluded; and ſo that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time is applyed to the whole, or both, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 44. which yet is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meant, with reference unto the one, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 39. And ſo there may (perhaps) be ſome more full Diſcovery, (though it be little Underſtood) as to Chriſt's Coming with the Seventh Trumpet's Sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; becauſe there is a ſeeming Series of Myſtical Numbers (in the Scripture) continued beyond that time, or till the Jews Converſion, as ſome conceive. But after which time, <hi>(viz.</hi> the literal Jews Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) no Sober Perſons do Pretend to any ſuch kind of Myſtical Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; till Chriſt himſelf ſhall Come in Perſon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Yet neither is that former Coming known by any Man.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In Reſpect of Punctuality, <hi>viz.</hi> the very Day and Hour, as is here Expreſſed; and wherein (poſſibly) the Emphaſis may lye. <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt</hi> was fulfilled unto a Day, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 41. whereas their coming out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> is onely ſaid to be in ſuch a Year, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 21, 22. And therefore Gentile-Saints may not Expect to know the very Day of their Redemption out of <hi>Babylon</hi> in
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:50213:131"/> the Myſtery, (much leſs out of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> Afterwards) ſince this would not be granted to the Jews of Old, who yet are firſt, in point of Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Priviledges, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 1, 2. But as the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi>'s Fall was ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied (as ſome conceive) within the Compaſs of a Year, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 29. and which fell out that very Night, <hi>v.</hi> 35. So Time will ſhew the Meaning of thoſe Ten Prophetical Days allotted unto Satan, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 10. whoſe Name is never mentioned in a Revelation ſence, but either before the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Beaſt came up, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 9. or after the Return of that Captivity, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Yet will I alſo grant, that no Man knoweth Certainly, (as <gap reason="foreign">

King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s Diſpenſation was a Type of Chriſt's, <hi>Amos</hi> 9. 11. and though he Knew, or did Believe, that he ſhould ſee the Goodneſs of the Lod (in that Reſpect) before his Death, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. 13. yet did he not certainly know the very Year of his Advancement; elſe would he not have fled to <hi>Achiſh,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27. 2. When <hi>Saul</hi>'s Deſtruction was to come in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more than one Year after, <hi>v.</hi> 7. compared with <hi>Chap.</hi> 29. 1. 11. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 31. 1.

But the Captivity of Myſtical <hi>Babylon</hi> (therein) Anwereth unto that of Old, which was to continue Seventy Years for certain; yet no Man certainly knew where to begin; elſe would not <hi>Daniel</hi> have been to ſeek ſo Near its End, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 1, 2, 3. I am perſwaded the Man of Sin was up, when Marriage was firſt Prohibited, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. 3. with 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 3. which was about the Year Three Hundred and Ninety; and ſo his Forty two Moneths muſt be Expired ſome Years ago. And after which the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake cometh, which uſhereth in the Seventh Trumpet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 13, 14, 15. But few may (yet) be of my Perſwaſion, nor do I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto Infallibility.</p>
                  <p>2. Becauſe few can Agree who are the Witneſſes, and what their Aſcending intimateth; much leſs do any know for Certain, how long the following Earthquake may continue. I do Believe, the Witneſſes are a very ſmall Number among Profeſſors, who have been Faithful
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:50213:131"/> unto THE Truth of ſuch a Time: But moſt ſuppoſe them to be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and Miniſters; though I conceive not how Magiſtrates (as ſuch) are capable of having Propheſied in a Sack cloath-ſtate. I do believe, the Witneſſes Aſcending doth import their being Taken out of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But moſt ſuppoſe it to intend their viſible Advancement in the World; the failing whereof (at ſuch a late Expected time) hath caſt them back again into the Wilderneſs. However, I dare not pretend to any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge, as to the Duration of the Earthquake; nor do I know any Man that Doth or May.</p>
                  <p>3. Becauſe the Diſpenſation of the Man of Sin is full of Darkneſs; which therefore is fitly Meaſured by the Moon or Moneths, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 2. with reference unto its Moon-like Light at beſt. And though Chriſt's VVitneſſes have alway had ſufficient Light, as to the Teſtimony of their Day; yet as Profeſſors have Relapſed into ſuch a Spirit again, ſo have they been (therewith) Benighted, as to their former ſeeming Light. This is our Caſe at preſent. How Evident (of late Years) was our being Near to <hi>Sion:</hi> But being overtaken with a <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Miſt, we know not (Generally) where we are. And they who da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with their Light, in point of Duty (as the moſt of Profeſſors have lately done) are juſtly Blinded or Benighted, as to the Matter of their Peace and Priviledges, <hi>John</hi> 7. 28. <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 42.</p>
                  <p>4. Becauſe the Generality have no mind to ſearch the Scriptures, nor yet to Ponder what is thence Offered for their Help, in ſome more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult caſes. <hi>Daniel</hi> underſtood by Books the Number of the Years of his Captivity, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 2. and Prophets (of Old) were wont to ſearch what manner of Time the Spirit of Chriſt in them did ſignifie, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10, 11. and thus is Knowledge to be gained, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 3, 4, 5. But as there is no fore-telling Prophet toward the End, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74. 9. ſo neither are there many ſearching ones: Yea, Ancient Prieſts (at ſuch a time) before their being laid aſide, Reject that Knowledge, for lack of which the People are Deſtroyed, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 6. And as an Hotter Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate diſpoſeth People to be ſlothful, as in <hi>Sodom, Ezek.</hi> 16. 49. ſo <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> cannot Hearken to Redemption ſignified, untill they ſee it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 6. 9.</p>
                  <p>5. Becauſe the ſtate of things (a little before the End) will be ſo likely (in an Eye of Reaſon) to Continue ſtill. Thus was it with <hi>David</hi> in his Time, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27. 1. and ſo with <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their Captivity, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 11. as well as <hi>Babylon,</hi> both in the Letter, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47. 8. and
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:50213:132"/> Myſtery, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 7, 8.

This will Occaſion ſome to ſcoff (in theſe laſt days) at ſuch a Promiſe, for ſince the Fathers fell aſleep, all things (ſay they) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue as they were, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3, 4. and they who grant the Promiſe in the General, will therefore yet ſay to the Laſt, the Time is not yet come, as thoſe of Old, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
                  <p>6. Becauſe the Lord hath Purpoſed, this very Time ſhall not be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known by any Man, as is here ſignified; which leadeth to the Next Queſtion.</p>

Thus <hi>Manoah</hi> might not Know that Angels Name, <hi>Judg.</hi> 13. 18. and good <hi>Eliſha</hi> had ſomething Hid from him, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 27. nor was it for thoſe Apoſtles to Know the Time and Seaſon, which the Father hath put in his own Power, <hi>viz.</hi> this Reſtauration, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>2. That ſo Chriſt's Coming in theſe Latter Days might Eminently Anſwer unto its being a Type or Sign of his own Perſonal Coming at the laſt. This ſeemeth to be that Sign of the Son of Man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 30. Now, Signs muſt Anſwer unto what is thereby ſignified; and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering in a Chief Reſpect (ſuch as This is) doth hint the Eminency of ſuch a Sign. Therefore <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> was the Higheſt Type of Chriſt, becauſe he was moſt like the Son of God, in that peculiar and moſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal point of Everlaſtingneſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 1. 3. Some other Diſpenſation (as that of <hi>Babylon</hi>'s Fall, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 13. 10. 13.) might Reſemble Chriſt's Laſt Coming, in ſeveral other Reſpects, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 25. but Abſolute Secrecy as to the Time, is Eminently reſerved for this Diſpenſation, as being its peculiar Sign.</p>
                  <p>3. To Exerciſe a Spirit of Enquiry in his moſt Inlightned ones: As God will be Enquired of, with reference unto the Matter of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 37. ſo with Reſpect unto the Time thereof, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11. as being of Special uſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8. 7.

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:50213:132"/> to make his Diſciples the more Inquiſitive, and to bring Hidden Matters before this Altar, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 31. Thoſe do Miſtake his Drift, who argue from a Secrecy, unto their being bound from ſearching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, ſave when that ſearch is abſolutely Forbidden, as <hi>Judg.</hi> 13. 18. <hi>Johns Revelations</hi> are full of Myſteries; yet Bleſſed is he who Reads that Book, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 3.

And if I muſt Needs fall, let me fall rather forwards, (in a Doubtfull Caſe at leaſt) which is leſs Dangerous of the Two, as in the Letter, ſo in the Myſtery. And as to Prudence, Chriſt witneſſed on her behalf (and to her Praiſe) who came Afore-hand with a Memorial of his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſuch as the Anoynting (or Embalming) of his Body was, <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 8. Nor doth it ſo much ſavour of worldly Wiſdom, to be too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in a Witneſs of this Nature, (which is ſo croſs to carnal Intereſt,) as to hang Back, till Providence hath put the matter out of all Diſpute.</p>

                  <p> 2. I ſee no Danger at all in Early Apprehenſions of this kind, when they are Duely bounded. Thoſe were Preſumptuous, who would Goe up and Fight (at ſuch a time,) directly Croſs to an Expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 43. but when the Scripture doth not forbid it, we then may ſafely Hope unto the End of Plauſible grounds: eſpecially, if matters of Practice (urged unto) are mainly founded on more ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial bottoms. Let any man evince the Interfering of my ſober Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations with the Scripture, and I ſhall then ceaſe therefrom: but elſe, the Lord takes pleaſure in his Peoples Hope, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 11.

                  <p>3. Yet is it Therefore meet we ſhould be very ſober in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures of this Nature: ſince No man Certainly doth Know how long (at leaſt) the Bridegroom may yet Tarry.

                  <p>4. Enquiries (with Sobriety) into this Hidden Myſtery, are no where Blamed, but Encouraged, as being of uſe, with reference unto theſe latter dayes. Indeed the Primitive Chriſtians were forbid to think, Chriſt's Proper Coming was Then at Hand, before the Man of Sin was up, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 2, 3. but Now the Reaſon of that Prohibition is Removed. Yea we are bid to Argue from ſuch evident Signs, as to the Drawing Near of our Redemption, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 8. and there is an Increaſe of Knowledge Promiſed unto the Runners to and fro, at ſuch a Time, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 4. nor is there any Danger hinted, ſave with reſpect to men's Delaying it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 48. Nor will it Repent us, if kept Awake, though by Diſcourſing as Men, or with Miſtakes.</p>
                  <p>5. Chriſt's chief Deſign, in bidding us to VVatch, (becauſe No man doth know that Day and Hour,) is to Provoke our being in a Preſent Readineſs, and to prevent our putting that Time off, or at ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diſtance. This is Apparent, both from his Explanation of it Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 40. and from the Reaſon of this Preſent Exhortation, <hi>viz.</hi> the fooliſh (unprepared) Virgins ſad Experience here, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Periſh, becauſe of their Preſuming upon longer time. So that
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:50213:134"/> Chriſt's Principal Meaning is, <hi>Ye know not [how ſoon] that Day will come, and therefore ye have need to Watch.</hi> From whence it followeth, that ſuch do utterly miſtake Chriſt's Drift and their own Intereſt, who are more fearful of being Haſty, than of Lingring, as to their Sober Expectations of this kind.</p>

Now, theſe poor Fooliſh Virgins ſtood (for ought we Read) unto their former Practice, of Going forth (at firſt) to Meet the Bridegroom: Therefore one may not watch, and yet be no Back-ſlider, unto ſuch an Height; or not turn back again to that which hath been formerly Declared againſt as Antichriſtian. Nay, Theſe had ſometime been in Fellowſhip with the VViſe; who therefore (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly) were pretty Blameleſs in their Lives, ſound in the Faith (or Main, ſo called) and very converſant about Religious Duties: Therefore one may continue Praying, Preaching, Hearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet not watch. Nay, Theſe are onely Taxed here, for not Going out the Second time, through lack of Oyl; which (when Awakened) they would have Borrowed, and went to Buy it: Therefore one may not watch, and yet be wakened; yea, very Trim as to ones Lamp or good Affections, nay (in Appearance) willing and Deſirous to be Compleat.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. In being Ready, or having All our Garments on; which is the Main thing (in the General) intended here. Chriſt's Coat was of one piece, <hi>John</hi> 19. 23. to ſignifie (perhaps) his being Dreſt at once: But we (poor Creatures) muſt be daily Adding, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. Graces are called Armour, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 12. which doth conſiſt of ſeveral pieces, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 14, 15, 16, 17. the whole whereof muſt be put on by us, <hi>v.</hi> 11. whoſe Life is a continual Warfare, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 18. One Open Guard expoſeth to a Deadly Wound, and ſhame may be Diſcovered by one Naked place; yea, more unto the ſhame of ſome, than Total Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is to others. Now, all complain of wanting ſomewhat, and which they ſee upon the Backs of others: But yet how Lightly do Profeſſors bear Convictions of their Imperfections, without a Care and Senſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming their Complaints.</p>

And let us alſo keep them on our Back, or by our putting them in ure; as Chriſt is ſaid to keep his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ſayings, <hi>John</hi> 8. 55. becauſe he did according thereunto: Since nothing will be ſaved in that Day, ſave onely our wearing Cloaths, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 18.

Nay, we muſt keep them alſo Girt; elſe flying Garments may be to our ſhame, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 15.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In being of a conſtant Sober Spirit, which is one Branch of Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and therefore is indefinitely required of us, together with our being vigilant, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. Thus is a Biſhop to be Vigilant and Sober, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2. and Aged Men, <hi>Titus</hi> 2. 2. yea, Deacons Wives, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 11. and every one, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 6. which may conſiſt with Hoping to the End, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 13. and with Rejoycing, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 4, 5. but not with Levity or Exceſs, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 7, 8. Indeed Sobriety is but a Vertue; yet it is ſo much wanting at this Day, as that a Sober Man is counted Gracious: and Lightneſs of Spirit in Profeſſors doth Argue both their lack of Grace and Vertue. Some do ſo far Indulge their Diſpoſition, as to forget the Diſpenſation they are under, which calls for Gravity, without Diſſimulation, or for a Sober Frame, as well as ſhew.</p>

This Lying in wait is Lawful, and a Duty; but little practiſed by thoſe, who Turn upon the Beds, as doth the Door upon his Hinges, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 14. or in a Paſſive way, as if Conjured into a Narrow Circle. And if Men were as much afraid of Sin, as Suffering, they would then catch at Light for Duty, as <hi>Benhadad</hi>'s Servants did at <hi>Ahab</hi>'s words, for Mercy, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20. 33.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. In making our Election ſure; which is the Great work of Time, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10; and more eſpecially at ſuch a time. Men in a Fire, are Firſtly carefull to ſave their Evidences: now ſince This Day will be with Burning and fewel of Fire, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 5. take heed your Evidences be not Burnt.

See therefore to the Ground you Build upon, and bring your Marks unto the Touch-ſtone; not taking upon Truſt; nor Truſting to what might ſuffice, as to being held Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with; ſince Goats will Now be ſet Aſide, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 32. which yet were Clean, for Sacrifice, and Food, or Saint-Communion Acts of Old.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us Occupy thoſe Talents which Chriſt hath betruſted us with for ſuch a Purpoſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 13. Each one hath put into his hand, according to his ſeveral Ability, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 15. and an Exact Account whereof is to be made at ſuch a Time, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 15; who therefore had need to VVatch. Some want Ability, as to ſome Kind of Talents; and Others, as to the ſame Degree, for that, which (in reſpect of Kind) is Equally communicated unto all. Thus are the Saints betruſted with peculiar Priviledges; yea, every Sinner with ſome kind of Talent; though Gradually Differing (both of them) each from other: and ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able whereunto, muſt be their Reckoning. Men muſt be accountable
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:50213:137"/> for their ſweet Illapſes, Croſſes, Opportunities for Duty, Helps there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and Outward Mercies; what they have Gained thereby: whoſe Duty it therefore is to Trade therewith; and to wards the End eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let us be much in Prayer, that we may not Enter into Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 38. but be accounted VVorthy to Eſcape, and ſtand before the Son of Man, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 36. Now one may be ſaid to Enter into Temptation, when ſomething is that way done, although not to the Height thereof; when ſinfull Motions are Parlyed with, or Satan is heard in a plain Caſe: When foiled Temptations are not purſued, but ſuffered to Riſe again: When Oppoſite Duty is not duely prized; and when we are not Deeply Humbled for a former Fall: In which regard, Prayer is of ſpecial ſecuring uſe, as it doth bring the Soul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God's Over-awing Preſence; as it enlivens other helps; and as it is the likelyeſt way to be Inſtructed and Aſſiſted from the Lord. Onely we muſt therein be Upright, Earneſt, Perſevering, and not Idle Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars, but free to Work.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. What manner of Perſons ought we to be, as to All Godlineſs and Holy Converſation, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 11; ſo as to be found of Chriſt in Peace, and without Spot or Blame, <hi>v.</hi> 14? Chriſt will Then come, and his Reward with him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 10: therefore let us now ply our Work apace; and let us not make light of Idle words, which then muſt be Accounted for, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 36. Each Talent (well Improved) will gain a City, in that Day, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 17: and little do many think how ſmall a matter will be ſufficient to Burn This World, as was to Drown the Other. How forcible (to make us Accurate) would be the conſtant Expectation of a Dying Hour, and the laſt Trumpets ſounding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Judgement? And with what Chearfulneſs doth a Tenant hear his Landlord Knock, whoſe Rent is Ready, and not to Borrow at ſuch a time?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Say not, A Confederacy with Threatning <hi>Aſhur, Iſa.</hi> 8. 12; whoſe Fall, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31. 8. immediately uſhereth in Chriſt's Diſpenſation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32. 1. Some will Confederate with him for Miſchief to God's Hidden Ones, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83. 4, 5, 8. and others (in <hi>Jeruſalem)</hi> through ſlaviſh Fear, directly croſs to a Divine Command. And therefore <hi>Hezekiah</hi> would not give him Pledges, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 36. 8; although he was not for Provoking Anſwers, <hi>v.</hi> 21. and thereupon was fortified from the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37. 6, 7. What Shame and Horrour will then ſurprize thoſe unrepenting <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> who have gone down for help to <hi>Egypt, Iſa.</hi> 31. 1. or to this King with Preſents, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 9? 'Tis very Probable, that <hi>Shebna</hi> was of this Confederacy, who ſometimes had the Key of <hi>David</hi>'s Houſe, but
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:50213:138"/> therefore forfeited his Place unto <hi>Eliakim, Iſa.</hi> 22. 21, before that Siege was raiſed, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 18.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Come out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> as all Gods People are bid to doe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 4. and more eſpecially at ſuch a Time. Now <hi>Babylon</hi> is to be Known; Partly, by her being very Tender and unacquainted with others Hardſhips, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47. 1, 2. Partly by her abounding with worldly Great ones, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 25. 28; and men of greateſt Note for Wiſdom, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 12: Partly, by making a God of <hi>Succoth-benoth,</hi> or Tents of Daughters, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 30; <hi>viz.</hi> the Numerouſneſs of their Party, though onely made up of Women: Partly, by her moſt cruel Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 17. and unnatural Oppreſſions, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14. 20: and Partly, by her Incorrigibleneſs, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51. 9. This <hi>Babylon</hi> is to be left, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51. 45. and all the Temple-Veſſels to be carried thence, which have been there Abuſed, as was of Old; ſince Every one found There (at ſuch a time) will be cut off, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 13. 15.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Forſake not the Aſſembling of your ſelves Together, and ſo much the more, as this Day ſeemeth to Approach, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25. Thoſe are no Watchers, (eſpecially in theſe latter dayes,) who are for meeting Aſunder, through fear of ſuffering for ſo clear a Duty. Thus let us therefore VVatch, in caſe freſh Perſecution ſhould ariſe, as hath oft done in former times, and after ſome Reſpite given. And as men would be kept Awake in that reſpect, ſo let them take heed of Truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Former Duty; much more, of pleading for a former Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or making light thereof; which is moſt likely to betray us into freſh Temptations. Yea, let us Adde mutual Exhortations unto other Means, whereby to counterpoiſe the Practice or Manner of ſome Others, with reference hereunto, as is there further ſignified, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Let us be Moderate in our Affections, with reference unto Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-comforts; and more Eſpecially, as the Time grows ſhort, or as the Faſhion of This world is ſeen to paſs Away, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 29, 30, 31. VVhich word tranſlated <hi>[Faſhion]</hi> doth ſignifie the Out ſide Cloathing of a thing or perſon, thus Chriſt was found in <hi>[Faſhion]</hi> as a Man, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 8. when he was cloathed with our Nature: ſo will the Preſent VVorld be changed (as a Veſture) at his Coming, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. 25. And that word <hi>[ſhort]</hi> is thought to be a Metaphor taken from a piece of Cloth, whoſe very End is onely left unrolled up: Or rather it doth im-import, that Time is Now put into its VVinding-ſheet; and ſo the ſame Greek VVord is rendred, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 6. Therefore 'tis Time to take our Affections Off from that, which is Now Dead, and Ready to be Buried.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <pb n="271" facs="tcp:50213:138"/> 9. Let us then Flee, out of <hi>Judea,</hi> into the Mountains, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 16. and much more out of Old <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> at ſuch a time, on pain of Death, <hi>Jer.</hi> 21. 9, 10, 11. 'Tis ſomething ſtrange, that it ſhould Ever be a Duty to goe into <hi>Babylon;</hi> but 'tis True, as <hi>Babylon</hi> denotes Confuſion, (or Going forth out of the City, into the Field,) and There ſhall <hi>Sion</hi> be Delivered, <hi>Mic.</hi> 4. 10. Thus are the Lord's Prieſts (or Eminent Saints) commanded to VVeep between the Porch and Altar, at ſuch a time, <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 17; which neceſſarily implyeth, their being Come out of that former Temple, wherein they had been wont to Miniſter. VVhich fleeing to the Mountains doth fitly ſuit with Meeting Chriſt in the Air at laſt, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 17; as being a Middle-ſtate, between the Earth and Heaven; or their being Covered in the ſhadow of his Hand, till he ſhall Plant the Heavens, and lay the Foundations of the Earth afreſh, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51. 16.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Remember <hi>Lot</hi>'s wife, ſaith Chriſt himſelf, with reference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Coming, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 30. 32. whom we are to Remember, as to her Sin and Puniſhment, together with the Circumſtances which relate unto them both. Her Sin was Looking Back (to <hi>Sodom)</hi> or Behind her, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 26. contrary to God's Expreſs Command, <hi>v.</hi> 17. which Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Back unfitteth for an Intereſt in his Kingdom, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 62. Her Puniſhment was, her being therefore turn'd into a Pillar of Salt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 26. which Salt doth ſeem to be a Part of <hi>Sodom</hi>'s Judgement, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 23. <hi>Lot</hi> onely was ſpoken to in that Command, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 17; yet his VVife periſhed for Diſobeying it: therefore take heed of Limiting Commands to thoſe whom they were onely firſt given forth unto. She alſo Died without Mercy, although ſhe was the VViſe of Righteous <hi>Lot:</hi> therefore Truſt not to Carnal Priviledges. And though ſhe had Come out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> yet did ſhe Periſh by the Way, for having an Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereunto, or Looking back Behind her.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Touch no Unclean thing; but be ye Clean, who bear the Veſſels of the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 11. By which word <hi>[Veſſels]</hi> are meant, thoſe Goſpel-Truths which have been carryed into <hi>Babylon:</hi> the Bearers whereof (from thence) are Prieſts and <hi>Levites, Ezra</hi> 8. 30. who typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Goſpel-Saints, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9: and <hi>Touching</hi> denotes Communion, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14. 17. Thus are we to ſtudy, wherein the Purity of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion doth conſiſt; or what it is that makes Unclean (according to the Myſtical Import of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law,) by its being Touched. And let us not be made to think, this Separation is unlawfull, if made by a Leſſer Number, or a Particular perſon; in caſe the VVhole (or Greater Number) be ſo Unclean; ſince the Command is Univerſal, the Reaſon is the ſame for every Part as for the Whole; nor have Particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

                  <p n="12">12. If we have eſcaped out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> let us take heed of ſtanding ſtill on this ſide that which is our Reſting place, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51. 50.

Thus let us not ſtand, as to our freſh Conceptions, Multiplying, ſmiting Anſwers, and Holy Zeal or Raging: Since <hi>Babylon</hi>'s Plagues may elſe be apt to over-take us; and if we ſtand (in ſuch a Caſe) we poſſibly may go no further, and ſo fall ſhort of <hi>Sion,</hi> which is as far from <hi>Babylon,</hi> as four Moneths Journeying can well Accompliſh, <hi>Ezra</hi> 7. 9.

Old men and Children abound with ſuch Affections; which therefore had need to be taken notice of, as men would ſhun the Caſualties, both of this Fall, and of the next Spring. Affections raiſed Above one's Judgement, are like the Speakers Voice above his Spirit; exceeding Prejudicial to the Matter in point of VVorth, as well as Acceptation. And yet, we therefore have ſo many Staggerers, becauſe they are as it were Drunk with over ſtrong Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; which therefore men have need to VVatch againſt. Onely take heed of ſinfull ſubtle Moderation, under a Pretence of Fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be Injudicious: but let our Zeal be under the Command of Knowledge, and let that Knowledge be purſued, then let us be as Hot as Fire.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

Declining Age (as in the Letter, ſo in the Myſtery) hath leaſt of Subſtance in it; which therefore moſt Delighteth in Toys and Circumſtances, as being moſt like unto it ſelf. But it is Weakly done, to Glory in that Fleſh, which as it was but Graſs at beſt, ſo is it (Now) ſure to Wither, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 6, 7, 8.

Men truly Gracious, are alway Growing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92. 12, 14. but Nature hath its ſtint, and thenceforth Lives upon its former ſtock, which therefore needs muſt waſte. This is the more Dangerous, becauſe it ſtealeth upon Souls and Bodies by Degrees; and not ſo violently, as in a fit of down-right ſickneſs. And though Gray Hairs can talk of a Conſumptive ſtate, (as in a Spiritual caſe ſome others do,) yet are they apt to let it Grow upon them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reſiſtance. But this alone had need to make us ſick, for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpewed out by him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 16. who turneth not unto his Vomit.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Lothneſs to be Tranſplanted, though for the Better. As all the <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſtuck faſt to <hi>Moſes, John</hi> 9. 28. So, few (if any) of <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples followed Chriſt, though by that means they entred not into his Heavenly Kingdom, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 11. Nature would fain be cloath'd upon, but not uncloath'd, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4. but none ſave Fools do look, that what is ſown ſhould ever quicken, except it Die, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 36.

Thus are ſome Acceſſary to their Spiritual Leanneſs, by their not following Chriſt into his Greener Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures: And as Men would facilitate their Removal with him, ſo let them take heed of Rooting deeper into other things than into him, which is a Vanity more common than Diſcerned.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A proneneſs to be too much in Love with out-ſide fairneſs, ſo as to Marry others (in the Myſtery) on that Account; as did the Sons of God with thoſe Fair Daughters of Men, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 2. a little before the Flood,

Such kind of Beauty muſt be expected then, as in the Face of ſome Conſumptive Perſons, a little before their Change; and wherewith many will be Enſnared. But let the Admirers of Parts and Moral Vertues know, and bear in mind, what brought the Deluge.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Aptneſs to be ſecure, and not to know, till Sufferings come. This will be the World's Temptation, to be ſure; yea, Chriſt ſaw need to bid his own take heed of promiſing too quick a Period to their Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <hi>Mark</hi> 13. 8, 9. I ſhould be glad, if <hi>Sion</hi> might be Delivered, without any further pain; but ſince ſhe hath not yet brought forth, we may conclude, her Laſt Pangs will be ſharpeſt. 'Tis true indeed, when Vermin once begin to Run (as ſome do at this Day already) that is one ſign the Houſe is Falling; but on the other ſide, when Eaves are ſeen to drop, long after a ſhower, it is an uſual Symptom of more Rain behind, becauſe it Argueth the Air to be ſtill very moiſt; and ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Droppings (of a Perſecuting Spirit) are ſtill continued.

                  <p n="7">7. Depending too much (in ways of Duty) upon Encouragements. Satan did ſometimes put the Queſtion, <hi>Doth</hi> Job <hi>fear God for Nought,</hi> Job 1. 9? but with Reſpect to Satan's Diſpenſation in theſe Latter Days, the Lord himſelf doth Ask, <hi>Who is there even among you</hi> (Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors) <hi>that would ſhut the Doors for Nought,</hi> Mal. 1. 10?

And when Chriſt was about to Change that preſent Diſpenſation, the <hi>Phariſees</hi> are chiefly Noted for their own
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:50213:144"/> Traditions, by which the Commands of God were made of none effect, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 6. And which Traditions were their underſtanding the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, according to the Judgment of their Ancients, right or wrong, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 43. their preſſing outward waſhing, (or Baptiſms, as in the <hi>Greck,)</hi> as Neceſſary to go Before Communion, <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 4.

                  <p n="12">12. A mighty proneneſs to Impoſe upon, Obſerve, and Cenſure others more than our ſelves; and to deal thus with ſome more than with others, in a ſinful way. Old Age is more for Talk, than Actions; as were the <hi>Phariſees, Mat.</hi> 23. 3. who never thought another's Burden Heavy enough, <hi>v.</hi> 4.

Yea, Chriſt and his Diſciples (who leaſt Deſerved it) had ſharpeſt Cenſures, and moſt Obſerving Eyes; (as Harmleſs <hi>Jeremy</hi> had from his <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Jer. 15. 10. Yea, Evil for Good, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18. 20.) while <hi>Herod</hi>'s Inceſt, and their own groſs Enormities were over-looked. But as this did evince their being Hypocrites in Chriſt's Opinion; ſo is it but a Folly Now, to think of Hiding inward ſleightineſs by Liveleſs Teſtimonies, and being Diſ-ſatisfied with another's Low Attainments, more than our own. It is a ſlye Temptation this, ſince Conſcience is pleaſed with Reproving ſin or Preſſing Duty; and Pride is for that Magiſterial Act, with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto another: Yea, under this Painted Tomb (of Verbal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations) the Old Man's Rottenneſs lyes undiſcovered, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 27, 28.

                  <p n="13">13. Miſ-apprehending the Voice of Providence; as to its Principal and Proper Meaning.

                  <p n="17">17. Enquiring the Mind of God with Idols in Heart, and ſtumbling-blocks of Iniquity before ones Face. Thus did ſome of the Jewiſh El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 1. 3. who were then carried into <hi>Babylon;</hi> as is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, from their Coming to this Prophet, <hi>v.</hi> 1. and ſitting probably in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Houſe, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8. 1. who then was in <hi>Chaldea,</hi> Ezek. 1. 3. though ſometimes (Viſionally) in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Ezek. 11. 1. but Now was brought (in Viſion) back again into <hi>Chaldea,</hi> v. 24. So that theſe Hypocritical Enquirers were Perſons carried out of Old <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reſt, as ſome may be whoſe Hearts are not ſincere. Which Idols in their Heart (when they did thus Enquire of God) might be, partly, their being Reſolved (Before hand) what to Believe; <hi>viz.</hi> what <hi>Hananiah</hi> and ſuch falſe Prophets ſaid, out of their own Hearts,

                     <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 2. and boldly Fathered it upon God, <hi>v.</hi> 7. which therefore was fitly called an Idol, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 3.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. Aptneſs to Queſtion God's Deſign of Laying Old <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> quite aſide: which ſeemeth to be hinted by the probable matter of their Enquiry before-mentioned, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 1. and as may be collected from God's following Anſwer, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was wholly Now to be laid VVaſte, (as <hi>Jeremy</hi> and this Prophet had declared;) or whether themſelves ſhould not be ſuddenly brought out of <hi>Babylon</hi> back again to Old <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as <hi>Hananiah</hi> had foretold, <hi>Jer.</hi> 28, 1, 2, 3, 4: ſo loth are ſome to leave their ancient Temple altogether, till they ſhall ſee it quite Demoliſhed. With reference unto which, God tells the Reſidue of thoſe in <hi>Babylon, Ezek.</hi> 14. 22. that Old <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>'s Ruines muſt goe on, though <hi>Noah, Daniel</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> were in it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 14. 18. 20; and her Inhabitants muſt be cut off, <hi>v.</hi> 21; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting a Remnant, who ſhall come unto theſe in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and Comfort them (with the ſight of their Wayes and Doings) concerning Old <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>'s Juſt Deſtruction, <hi>v.</hi> 22, 23. VVhich ſtaggering at the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of things, was that which <hi>John</hi> and his Diſciples laboured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when the Preparatory or Deſtructive part of Chriſt's Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration (anſwering to that of <hi>Babylon)</hi> was Begun: as is Apparent from their asking, <hi>Art thou He? Mat.</hi> 11. 3. The Reaſon of which Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was, <hi>John</hi>'s being Now caſt into Priſon, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 2; who For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had VVitneſſed unto that Truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 29. but was Now at ſome Kind of Loſs; whom therefore Chriſt then call'd a Reed, that was ſhaken with the VVind, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 7; and by which Character <hi>John</hi> and his Followers (at ſuch a time) are to be Known. And from Chriſt's Anſwer may be gathered, how ſcrupling Baptiſts may be ſatisfied, that Chriſt is He, in caſe that Goſpel is Now preached (onely) to the Poorer ſort; and if the Blind and Lame, and Leapers, and Deaf and Dead (among them) be ſtrangely wrought upon, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 4. 5; which argueth his Over-turning Diſpenſation to be Now on foot, according to the Scriptures, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 1. and 35. 6.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Unſteadineſs in that (upon a freſh Temptation) which hath been Manfully Returned unto, or Begun. This was their Caſe of Old; who did Begin to build the Temple, or Open VVorſhip, <hi>Ezra</hi> 4. 1. till the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> ſpirit in that Day, <hi>v.</hi> 2. prevailed ſo far as to prohibit them, and whereupon that VVork did ceaſe, <hi>v.</hi> 24.

                  <p n="20">20. Shortneſs of Spirit; or being unable to Hold pace with Chriſt, unto the End of his deſigned Journey. It is with ſome Men, as with Poſt-horſes, who have their Stages, beyond which they will not be made to goe, with ſwitch or ſpur, and ſo their Rider is neceſſitated to take other. This is foretold at large, (with reference unto the Latter dayes,) by that remarkable Viſion concerning ſeveral Horſes, of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Colours, by which their ſpirit or mettle is commonly judged of, <hi>Zech.</hi> 6. 2, 3. and as they were Types of divers Spirits, <hi>v.</hi> 5.

Which Griſled and Bay, do ſeem to have been ſometimes Joyn'd together, in One Chariot at the Firſt, <hi>Zech.</hi> 6. 3. but at the Laſt they part, as is

Onely the Griſled (or Dapple-gray) being Better than the Black or White, goe forth unto the South, <hi>Zech.</hi> 6. 6. or Nearer to the Sun; though Theſe are alſo ſatisfied with their reſpective ſingle quarter.

And which Miſtake will not be Trivial; ſince they (and they alone) who know the Joyful ſound, ſhall walk, O Lord, in the Light of thy Countenance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 15. in thy Name ſhall they Joy, and be Exalted in thy Righteouſneſs, <hi>v.</hi> 16. Whereas Miſtakers (in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard) can neither look to ſhare in thoſe peculiar Priviledges, nor yet to Underſtand their ſpecial Duty, which is Depending upon Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Times, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. 32.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. Deſerring that Day, through Unbelief; or being too much in Love with Preſent things. Thus ſome will not Believe for Joy, as

This will betray ſome into Senſuality, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 48. others will therefore ſay, <hi>Come, Let us Build,</hi> Ezek. 11. 3. and others, that Viſions (or Diſcourſes) of that Nature, are to no Effect, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 12, 22, 23. But this Delaying it, (though onely in one's Heart) is ſaid to be the Character of an Evil Servant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 48. and one of thoſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. 1. who ſaid, <hi>It is not Near, v.</hi> 3. was therefore ſtruck with ſudden Death, <hi>v.</hi> 13. Yea, this Deferring of it, is quite contrary to Chriſt's Deſign, in this whole Parable and other Scriptures; which therefore had need be watch'd againſt, as that which is the Bane of watching in the General.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. Groundleſs Preſuming upon Mercy, to the laſt. Thus Old <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>'s Inhabitants were apt to Fanſie, that the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, <hi>Jer.</hi> 37. 9. becauſe they had with-drawn a while, through fear of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Army, <hi>v.</hi> 5. and would have had the Prophet to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with them, <hi>v.</hi> 3. Thus in all probability, thoſe Ante-deluvian Sons of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 2. did Hope, they ſhould not All be Waſh'd away, according to the Rigour of that Sentence, <hi>v.</hi> 7, elſe would they not have ſo Neglected Haſtening into that Ark; the like Figure where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto (in point of ſaving us in ſuch a Day) is Now Chriſt's Baptiſm or Diſpenſation, and our being gathered up into it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 20, 21. Diſtinct from <hi>John</hi>'s, as at Chriſt's firſt Appearing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 11. and as is hinted in that 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21, Yea, when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was laid waſte, yet the Inhabiters of thoſe waſtes preſumed they ſhould Inherit them, becauſe of their being Many, and <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Children, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 24. though of the ſame Spirit with thoſe Before, <hi>v.</hi> 25, 26. who therefore were alike Deſtroyed, <hi>v.</hi> 27. And thus will Fooliſh Virgins Hope, that ſo many Perſons and Profeſſors of their Parts and Gifts, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Graces, will not be wholly laid aſide, untill the Door ſhut upon them will Decide the Controverſie. This is that Great Temptation, with reference unto which, Chriſt biddeth All to VVatch at ſuch a time.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. Aptneſs to call in Queſtion the Exerciſe of God's Diſpoſing Providence, in ſuch an Abſolute Confuſed ſtate of things. Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being out of Courſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82. 5. what can the Righteous do, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11. 3? Yea, therefore ſome will ſay, <hi>Where is the God of Judgment,</hi> Mal. 2. 17? The Earth will then be without Form, and void, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens alſo will have no Light, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 23. as in the <hi>Chaos,</hi> at the firſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 2. which needs muſt have Aſtoniſh'd <hi>Adam,</hi> if he had Then been Made; much more his Fallen Poſterity, who will be Now in Being.
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:50213:152"/> But though God is no Author of Confuſion in a Moral ſence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 33. yet doth he own his being the Creator of Afflicting Darkneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 7. who alſo can improve all manner of Darkneſs and Confuſion, to Aggravate the Luſter of his following Light and Order, as in the firſt Creation. Yea, thoſe are Weariers of him (and therefore will be ſoon caſt off,) who do thence Argue, his being Abſent, as well as They, who therefore ſay, <hi>He is Delighted in Evil Doers,</hi> Mal. 2. 17.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. Eminent Profeſſors (or ſuch as <hi>Joſhua</hi> the High Prieſt was) will then be apt to be Reſiſted (yea, to be Overcome, without Chriſt's Help) by Satan, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 1, 2. or under Satan's Diſpenſation, in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation ſence, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 10. which Anſwereth to that time in <hi>Zechary.</hi> The Matter of which Conteſt, Relateth to the Body of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as is more plainly ſignified, <hi>Jude</hi> 9. where this very Form of words <hi>[The Lord Rebuke thee]</hi> is quoted hence. Nor need we ſtick at his being called <hi>[Michael]</hi> in <hi>Jude,</hi> who is here <hi>[Called the Lord]</hi> Zech. 3. 2. ſince Chriſt is granted to be meant, by that word <hi>Michael, Rev.</hi> 12. 7. as Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> there confeſſeth, although he doth Diſtinguiſh them, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 1. However, Chriſt might ſpeak this in <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 2. and <hi>Michael</hi> (or a Created Angel, Employed by Chriſt in this Conteſt) might ſpeak the ſame words afterwards, as <hi>Jude</hi> Relateth. And ſo, by <hi>[Moſes his Body]</hi> is meant his Miniſtration; which <hi>Joſhua</hi> (then) was Tempted to keep up in Rigour, or elſe to lay it quite aſide: As he was a Tye of others in theſe Latter Days, Comparing Times with Times.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Joſhua</hi> might be Tempted to keep that Miniſtration up in Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, as to the Tabernacle-ſtate (in <hi>Moſes</hi> his Time) in Competition with the Preſent Temple; becauſe the Building of this Latter <hi>(viz.</hi> the Temple) was Now Prohibited, and therefore Perillous. Thus have ſome Argued of Later times, (or ſince the Prohibition iſſued forth) that a Leſs Solemn, and more Private Worſhip (ſuch as that in the Tabernacle in the Days of <hi>Moſes)</hi> was more Agreeable unto their Preſent Wilderneſs condition, than what is of an Open Temple-Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Yea, ſome are Tempted to Obſerve <hi>Moſes</hi> his Seventh-day-Sabbaths, and other Ordinances, upon this Account.</p>
                  <p>Or, Secondly, <hi>Joſhua</hi> might then be Tempted to lay that Inſtituted Miniſtration quite aſide, becauſe of Troubles in the Keeping of it up: Pretending its having been Aboliſhed in <hi>Babylon.</hi> And thus ſome may be Now Tempted to conceive, that Goſpel-Inſtitutions are no more to be Regarded, as having been carried into <hi>Babylon,</hi> and not to be Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red again.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Joſhua</hi> Overcame, in that Conteſt; and Chriſt will give an
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:50213:153"/> Effectual Rebuke to Satan, on the behalf of ſuch, as he then did: which is good News to Them, but ſad to Others, who are in bondage unto that Temptation; ſince the Neglect of typical Temple-worſhip (then) was ſo ſeverely witneſſed againſt; and ſince the Reviving of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Authority (Now) is ſo directly croſs unto a Goſpel rule, <hi>Rom</hi> 7. 4. 7; and ſince the Reſtauration of Goſpel-Inſtitutions (after the full Return of <hi>Babylon</hi>'s Captivity in the Myſtery) is ſo Expreſſely ſignified, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 19. and in a Way of full Agreement with that in the Letter of Old. And Preſently upon the Rebuking of which Temptation, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>Joſhua</hi> was cloath'd with Change of Raiment, <hi>v.</hi> 4. and had a Promiſe of Preſiding in Chriſt's Houſe, and Walking with thoſe who then ſtood by, <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>viz.</hi> the Angels, <hi>v.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. A Stealing of the Word of God (by ſome) each from his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; as in the Day of Old <hi>Jeruſalem, Jer.</hi> 23. 30. which VVord of God (in all probability) was, that VVord which <hi>Jeremy</hi> had there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared (a little before) concerning the VVhirlwind of God, that was gone forth in Fury, to fall upon the Head of that wicked Generation, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 19. and not to Return, untill the thoughts of his Heart were Executed and Performed, <hi>v.</hi> 20. This VVord the Devil (in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments) endeavoureth to Steal (or Catch away) from others, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 19: Partly, by making a Deriſion of his Meſſage, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20. 8. and loading his Perſon with falſe Reports, <hi>v.</hi> 10. that People might not Hear him, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 20: and Partly by ſubſtituting their Falſe VVord inſtead of his, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 25. with utmoſt Confidence, <hi>v.</hi> 31. on purpoſe to make the People Forget the Other, <hi>v.</hi> 27; yea (poſſibly) offering to Prove their Own falſe Prophecy, (concerning <hi>Babylon</hi>'s being then to be Broken, as <hi>Hananiah</hi> did Aſſert, <hi>Jer.</hi> 28. 2.) from <hi>Jeremy</hi>'s own words againſt <hi>Elam,</hi> Jer. 49. 35. in the Beginning of <hi>Zedekiah</hi>'s Reign, <hi>v.</hi> 34. ſince <hi>Elam</hi> then was under <hi>Babylon,</hi> as ſome doe (very Probably) conceive. But as this ſort of Stealers are Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 22. ſo doth the Lord declare himſelf to be Againſt them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 30: and as, if he be For us, VVho then can be Againſt us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 31? ſo if he be Againſt a man, who Can, who VVill, who Dare be For him? Yea, 'tis Expreſſely ſaid, with reference to ſuch a Time, that as there will be Stealers then, ſo will a flying Curſe purſue them, and Cut them off, with their whole Houſe, <hi>Zech.</hi> 5. 3, 4.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. The having of ſome men's Perſons too much in Admiration. Thus were the <hi>Phariſees</hi> (at ſuch a time) in High Eſteem, <hi>Luk</hi> 16. 15. among thoſe men by whom Chriſt was Deſpiſed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 3.

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:50213:153"/> Houſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22. 15. 21, 22; ſo Chriſt himſelf did ſuffer <hi>Judas</hi> to be his Steward, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 20. a little before the ſetting up of his Own Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, who therefore Doubtleſſely was moſt Eſteemed by his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. Thus ſome make bold to Linger (at this day) in ſpiritual <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> becauſe of Righteous <hi>Lot's</hi> Example, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 16. and will Diſpute Eſcaping to the Mountains, becauſe <hi>Lot</hi> did ſo, <hi>v.</hi> 17. 18; eſpecially conſidering his Gracious words then uttered, <hi>v.</hi> 19. and God's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of him, <hi>v.</hi> 21. but not his Portion afterwards, <hi>v.</hi> 30. 36. Yea thus ſome argue from the General Faith and Practice of Profeſſors, unto the Warrant of Believing as they doe; and Daring others to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn ſo many Holy ones. But though God knoweth who are His, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. and how to Deliver the Godly in ſuch Caſes, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9; yet is it Deſperately Preſumptuous, to ſet Our good Opinion of any Perſon, in competition with Chriſt's Command, and ſo to honour Them more than Him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 29; which is the ready way to Periſh, <hi>v.</hi> 30, 31. 35.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. Aptneſs to fanſie its being a Duty to be meerly Paſſive, and not Active, in a way of ſelf-delivery out of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Thus have ſome plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Time was not yet come for Temple-work, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. 2; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Law of Man was ſtill in Force, <hi>Ezra</hi> 4. 21. although directly Croſs to God's Command, <hi>Ezra</hi> 6. 14: till they had almoſt quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done themſelves, both as to Temporals, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. 9. and Spirituals, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 14. And thus, ſome Dare not ſtirre out of a Preſent (though Corrupted) ſtate, till Providence doth Force them out; as thoſe of Old, whom therefore God bad to Deliver Themſelves, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2. 7; which leaveth Others (at this day) without Excuſe. It is a Scruple (this) againſt the very Law of Nature; ſince every living Infant (in the Womb) is ſome way Active to its own Production; and therefore <hi>Ephraim</hi> had not the Wit of an unborn Child, for ſtaying ſo long, till ſetched out, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13. 13. which is a ſad ſign the Child is Dead. But <hi>Jeremy</hi> went ſorth of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to ſeparate himſelf from thence, and in the Midſt of all the People, <hi>Jer.</hi> 37. 12; till he was Forcibly brought back again, and put in Priſon, <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14, 15. which others cannot truely ſay, they are, as to their tarrying in their ancient Temples, and Active Complyance with unrighteous Laws.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. Aptneſs in ſome to Murmure, becauſe of Others Equal Pay (for One Hours labour) with Themſelves, on whom the Heat and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the Day had fallen; as Chriſt Expreſſely ſignifieth, with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto his Day, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 11, 12: much more in caſe theſe Later labourers ſhall have All, as ſeemeth to be intimated, <hi>v.</hi> 16. and as the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were to have, in competition with the <hi>Jews, Mat.</hi> 6, 11, 12.
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:50213:154"/> Thus might <hi>Abiathar</hi> take it ill, that he, who Firſt came unto <hi>David</hi> in his Low Condition, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 20. was afterwards made to give place to <hi>Zadok,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. 3. who came not in till <hi>David</hi> was come to <hi>Hebron,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. 23. 28. eſpecially when <hi>Zadock</hi> (in the Iſſue) was High-Prieſt Alone, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 27. 35; and wherein <hi>Zadock</hi> was a Type, with reference unto theſe Latter dayes, <hi>Ezek</hi> 44. 13, 15. Thus alſo <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples did Repine, to ſee their Maſter's Succeſſor Preferr'd before him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 25, 26. and ſo will ſome of Chriſt's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples doe, (upon a like occaſion, to be looked for) in caſe they be not well laid in with Self denyal againſt that ſore Temptation; ſince Firſt and Laſt muſt Counter march in ſuch a Day, and wherein (partly) will appear his Glory, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 15, 16.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. Withſtanding Chriſt, at leaſt by Praying (Peremptorily) Againſt that which the Lord hath ſignified to be his Purpoſe. Indeed, there was a Time, when God ſought for a man to ſtand in Old <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s Gap, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 1. and Then might <hi>Jeremy</hi> have ſafely Prayed for that People, whom afterwards the Lord Prohibited, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 16. We know not what to pray for, as we Ought, ſave as the Spirit helpeth us therein, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. according to the Will of God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 14. There is a Time for Silence, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 3. 7; and much of Prudence doth appear in being ſilent at ſome time, <hi>Am.</hi> 5. 13. with reference unto our Deprecating an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting Providence, <hi>Am.</hi> 6. 10. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> Prayed for <hi>Sodom,</hi> but within Compaſs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 32; becauſe he knew what God would doe, <hi>v.</hi> 17. and therefore <hi>Jeremy</hi> (in ſuch a Caſe) did onely Threaten thoſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 37. 6, 7, 8. who did Requeſt his Praying for them, <hi>v.</hi> 3. And though <hi>Iſaiah</hi> (in the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi>'s Day) Pray'd for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 20. as it did ſhadow out Chriſt's Kingly Intereſt; yea though ſome are Commanded (then) to Pray for ſparing Mercy, <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 17. yet did the Lord Reveal (at ſuch a time) that ſin which then was unto Death, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22. 14. and which ſhould not be Prayed for, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 16. the Knowledge whereof is a Peculiar Gift, by which thoſe of that Other Spirit have been Diſtinguiſhed from the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                  <p n="45">45. Reproaching thoſe of the Separation, as ſavouring of Carnality and Worldly Eaſe, compared with thoſe who ſtill Continue in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer State. Thus did the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples cenſure Chriſt and his, becauſe Theſe Faſted not, as did the Other, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 14. And thus ſome may upbraid withdrawers from them, as having Eaſed themſelves of many Burdens, which They ſtill bear. Thus, if <hi>John</hi> be Auſtere, he hath a Devil, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 18. if Chriſt be otherwiſe, he is Licentious, <hi>v.</hi> 19. but Wiſdom is Juſtified of her Children. And yet as Chriſt's
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:50213:154"/> Diſciples Could not Faſt (at ſuch a time,) as did the Other, becauſe of their Different Apprehenſions about the Preſent Diſpenſation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 15: ſo neither could the Other (Truely) count themſelves more Heavy Laden; conſidering what Chriſt and his Diſciples met with for their ſeparating from the <hi>Phariſees;</hi> far worſe than what the Other groaned under. And as it argueth Little Zeal for Duty, to count it Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 13. ſo God Accepted not their ſelf-impoſed, Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>afflicting Exerciſes, in a <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> State, <hi>Zech.</hi> 7. 3 5: much more will Chriſt ſoon reckon with thoſe, who thus Reproach his Peoples Duty with that Diſgracefull name of Carnal Liberty.</p>
                  <p>THus have I now finiſhed the Explication of theſe words. It onely Remaineth, to conclude the whole (both of this Verſe and Parable) with a few words of Exhortation, to be Watchful in the General, or with reſpect to Every of thoſe forementioned Particulars. In order whereunto, theſe following Motives may be of uſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Motive</hi> 1. This work of Watching, is incumbent upon All, <hi>Mark</hi> 13. 37. which Virgins therefore have no cauſe to think much at. All are not Bound (as ſome may be) to Watch for Others, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17: but Every man is bid to prove Himſelf, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. and his Own work, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 4. or to work out his Own Salvation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12. Thoſe are Soul damningly Preſumptuous, who Truſt unto Another's watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their Souls, and therefore ſleep themſelves; as in a Bodily caſe: ſince Every ſelf neglective Soul ſhall Die in his Iniquity, together with his Careleſs Watchman, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 8. Now if Profeſſors ſhould do more than Others, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 47; will ſuch fail in a Common Duty? No Servant will refuſe the doing of what his Maſter may expect from Others; and Virgins do Profeſs themſelves to be Chriſt's moſt Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and Proper Servants; whoſe being ſuch, is to be Evidenced by their Watching, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 37. and VVaiting for him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 36.</p>
                  <p>2 Saints have their Name from hence; who therefore (Eminently) are called VVatchers, as well as makers of Decrees, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 17. VVhich Holy ones may be ſo termed there, Partly with reference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Others; but Chiefly with reſpect unto Themſelves. Thus was <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> made a VVatchman to his fellow Captives, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 7: but to keep Others Vineyards, and not one's Own, is that which Spouſes may confeſs with ſhame, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 6. And if a ſpiritual ſleeper (in the General) is called Dead, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 14. much more a ſlumbring Virgin or Profeſſor, who hath his Name from VVatching. Therefore Chriſt
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:50213:155"/> ſaid to <hi>Peter; Simon, Sleepeſt Thou,</hi> Mark 14. 37? as being worſe in Him (becauſe of his Profeſſion) than in ſome other. And as None can be Waking, in caſe the Watchers be Aſleep: So He muſt look to Suffer more than all the reſt, for his Names-ſake, <hi>Mark</hi> 13. 34.</p>
                  <p>3. How vigilant are ſinners in their Evil way; who cannot ſleep till they have done ſome Miſchief, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 16. Yea, who are moſt awake (or Active) in the Night, and who are therefore waiting for the Twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, <hi>Job</hi> 24. 15! Now, if it be a ſhame for Men (in what is uſeful) to be Inferiour unto Brutes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 3. or Birds, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8. 7. or Creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 6. much more for Saints to be out-ſtript by Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in their Reſpective Watching; Eſpecially ſince Saints themſelves have ſometimes been (as ſinners are) exceeding Vigilant, in a ſinful way; whoſe Change (by Grace) doth not Diminiſh (but rather add unto) their Circumſpection, although with reference unto a Changed Object. In which regard, Believing <hi>Paul</hi> did Perſecute ſtill (as in the <hi>Greek)</hi> or follow after that Truth in Love unto it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12. which he had formerly Perſecuted Others for, in way of Hatred, <hi>v.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>4. Others are watching for our Halting, and therefore we have need to take heed to our ways. How was Chriſt watched by the <hi>Phariſees, Mark</hi> 3. 2. and <hi>Jeremy</hi> by his Familiars, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20. 10. and <hi>David</hi> by his Obſervers, which made him Pray for being Led in a plain Path, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. 11! Which being ſo Narrowly Obſerved by others, may prove our great Advantage; it being ſo Natural to be Remiſs, if winked at by Fellow-Creatures. Yea, ſome muſt look to be Enticed, as <hi>Jeremy</hi> was, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20. 10. on purpoſe to make a Breach upon our Principles, whereby to be Revenged of us, for a Differing Practice or Profeſſion. In which regard, Chriſt biddeth his Diſciples to be wiſe as Serpents, and to Beware of Men, who watch for ſomething by which to Colour over their Deſigned Miſchief, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 16, 17. Thoſe of the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have been alway Cenſured for their over-ſtrictneſs; but if the leaſt Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e be to be ſeen upon them, it will be put into their Eye; who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have need to Watch and Keep their Garments.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Be therefore Vigilant, becauſe your Adverſary the Devil, as a Roaring Lion, walketh about, ſeeking whom he may Devour,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 8. And as this was his Practice alway, ſo more eſpecially, muſt <hi>Joſbua</hi> look to be Reſiſted by him at This Day, which Anſwereth unto that of Old, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 1. He can apply Temptations ſuitable to our Tempers; yea, he can ſhrewdly Gheſs at our Inclining thereunto, and ſo Purſue them in their fitteſt Seaſon. And what would not he give, to have his Will (next unto Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 9.) upon ſome Chriſtians, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7? He knoweth who is likelieſt to be his Greateſt Adverſary;
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:50213:155"/> whom he would therefore win, or weaken by ſome Fall: Yea, were it onely to prevent their Near approaching Crown, whom he doth therefore ſtronglieſt Tempt at ſuch a Time, as in that Caſe of <hi>Joſhua, Zech.</hi> 3. 1, 5. He alſo hath Devices on both hands, or under a moſt ſair Pretence, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11. by which he will get an Advantage, in caſe we be not very Vigilant, wherein it is a ſhame to be out-ſtripped by him.</p>
                  <p>6. Chriſt alſo is called a Watcher, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 13. which is there plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meant of Him; as by his being ſingularly (there) ſpoken of; ſo by that Work it ſelf, <hi>v.</hi> 14. which Primarily belongeth unto Him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his People ſhare with him, both in that Work and Name, <hi>v.</hi> 17. who is ſo called, partly, becauſe he Watcheth (or Keepeth) his Vineyard Day and Night, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 3. for he that Keepeth <hi>Iſrael</hi> doth not ſlumber, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 121. 3. and if he watcheth them, ſhall not They watch Themſelves? Yea, he (as Man) did ſometimes watch, in ſuch an Hour of Temptation, to ſet us an Example, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 38. <hi>And could ye not Watch with Me?</hi> ſaid he to his Diſciples, <hi>v.</hi> 40. He alſo (as Mediator) watcheth ſtill, and Prayeth for his <hi>Peters, Luke</hi> 22. 32. which ſhould provoke Their joyning with him in that Work, <hi>v.</hi> 46. as <hi>Joſhua</hi> was to Fight whilſt <hi>Moſes</hi> was at Prayer, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 9. though <hi>Iſrael</hi> Prevailed upon <hi>Moſes</hi> his Account, <hi>v.</hi> 11. as if Chriſt doth not Keep, the Watch-man waketh but in vain, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127. 1. yet ſhould we therefore work, becauſe God worketh in us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12, 13.</p>
                  <p>7. As watching is incumbent upon All, <hi>Mark</hi> 13. 37. and in All Things, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5. ſo at All Times, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 36. which therefore ought not to be wondred at, if Now required; but ſhould be more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, on that Account. In which regard, it may be ſaid of watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, as it is ſaid of Holineſs, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 6. and Brotherly Love, <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10. which is not any New Command, <hi>v.</hi> 7. ſave with Reſpect unto a Circumſtantial Variation, <hi>v.</hi> 8. as Legal Duty is Now turned into Evangelical; and as our watching (in the General,) is Now Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in Relation to the Duties and Temptations of ſuch a Particular Time. Now, when Chriſt putteth (upon his) none other Burden, ſave what they have already; he ſignifieth it as a Motive to Hold faſt that which they have, untill his Coming, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 24, 25. And if Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience be our Centre, as we draw Nearer to its End, ſo will our Motion be the quicker, as is to be Obſerved in a falling Arrow. And if Men very Aged, (or drawing nigh unto their Diſſolution) are alſo moſt Awake, or apt to Riſe up at the voice of an Early Bird, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12. 4. it will be to Their ſhame, who are moſt Heavy Headed, in a Spiritual ſence, a little before their dropping into the Grave.</p>
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:50213:156"/>
                  <p> 8. Sleep is ſo Natural, (as in the Letter) and pleaſing to the Fleſh, eſpecially unto ſome, which is another Motive to be Watchful. In Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral caſes (to be ſure) we may conclude that to be Excellent which Nature (at leaſt Corrupted Nature) is averſe unto: And ſuch is Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Vigilancy. The Old Man is ſo called, partly, becauſe of Drou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; and if the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinleſs Nature was apt to ſleep, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 21. as being of an Earthly Make, <hi>v.</hi> 7. much more doth ſin diſpoſe thereunto, and more eſpecially in this Moral ſence. And though ſome cannot ſleep (as others do) or ſin to ſuch an Height, yet do All Love to ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or Dally with Temptations of a ſinful Nature. And as Men of a more Feeble Spirit, and Cold Complexion, and Groſſer Bodies, are moſt Heavy-headed, in the Letter; ſo let thoſe look about them, in the Myſtery, whoſe ſtrength is gone, whoſe Love is Cold, and who are moſt encompaſſed with this World's Fatneſs. Nor ever had the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch Advantages (as Now) in point of Watchleſsneſs; it being Now ſo Univerſal; which yet ſhould ſtir up others to be Singular.</p>
                  <p>9. Some (at this Day) have need to watch, becauſe they are ſo much Alone; as did the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> upon that Account, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. 7. He that will be (as Sparrows are) upon the Houſe-top, muſt look (in Times of Danger) to be Alone: And wo be unto him, whoſe ſolitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (at ſuch a Time) and ſleepineſs are in Conjunction. Theſe are Dividing Times, wherein we therefore ſhould be gathered up (ſo much the more) into our ſelves, and into ſelf-defending Circumſpection. Thoſe are poor Creatures, and have Nought to Loſe, who can ſleep in a ſolitary Cottage; which is the caſe of ſeveral Now, who have been wont to Live in Families. Let ſcattered ones improve this Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in a ſelf-rouzing way; whom Providence hath Now conſtrained to be Watchful, and which may prove a great Advantage. Now is the Watchmens Day of Viſitation, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 4. wherein Old Shepherds ſhall be made to ceaſe from Feeding the Flock of God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 10. onely Lambs Feeding alone are in great Danger, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 16. who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had need to watch themſelves, as they would not become the roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lions Prey, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8.</p>
                  <p>10. The Spiritual Nature of Chiefeſt Duties and Temptations, doth call for Watching, at the Higheſt Rate. The very firſt Principle of Goſpel-Duty is ſelf-denial, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 24. a Failure wherein, is ſo far from being Cenſured by the Generality, that Men will Praiſe thee, when thou doſt Well unto thy ſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 18. Yea, Conſcience alſo is un-acquainted with Holy Gurioſities, or Time-concernments; which therefore may be over-looked without any inward Check, ſave as we are under Conſcience, unto Chriſt. Groſſer Temptations are like
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:50213:156"/> Swords or Spears, which being more Obvious, may therefore be more Eaſily avoyded: but Time temptations are like Arrows; more out of ſight, which are more Dangerous, and by which <hi>Saul</hi> (for all his Shield, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 21.) was Deadly wounded, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31. 3. Now as we are to <hi>Watch</hi> in Prayer, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 2. becauſe that Duty is moſt ſpiritual; ſo have Saints need to be Compleatly armed, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 11. becauſe they Wreſtle not with Fleſh and Blood, but ſpiritual Wickedneſs in High Places, <hi>v.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>11. It elſe will evidence our being Poor; ſince the Rich man's Abundance will not ſuffer him to ſleep, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5. 12. Worldly Poor men ſleep moſt ſecurely; and ſpiritual Sleepers may be concluded Poor, as are unarmed Travellers in Thieviſh wayes. Sinners are either Real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poor, (as to what Souls are ſubject to be Robbed of;) or elſe ſuch know not the Worth of what they have, elſe would they be more Watchfull. Their Portion is in this Life onely, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. 14; who cannot Reſt, if That be hazarded, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 15: but matters of a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual nature are Another's <hi>(viz.</hi> the Saints Own, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 12.) which therefore Sinners care not to ſecure. As where the Treaſure is, there will the Heart be alſo, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 34; ſo when the Heart is in a ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring Frame, 'tis from the Want of ſpiritual Treaſure. VVhereas, they who have Moſt of Grace and Joy, are alway fearfull leſt they ſhould Loſe it; who therefore keep a conſtant VVatch, becauſe they Know the VVorth of ſuch Commodities, and their continual Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                  <p>12. <hi>In caſe I ſin,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job</hi> to God) <hi>Thou Markeſt me,</hi> Job 10. 14. <hi>Thou lookeſt Narrowly to All my paths,</hi> Job 13. 27; <hi>Doſt thou not Watch over my Sin,</hi> Job 14. 16? And if it be ſo, then <hi>Job</hi> and we had need to VVatch Againſt it. 'Tis true, God Marketh Iniquity (in his People) with a Forgiving Eye; but that Forgiveneſs worketh Fear, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. 3, 4: yea his very Marking it, doth make them VVatch againſt it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44. 20, 21. And with reſpect unto theſe Latter dayes, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents himſelf as one that Hearkeneth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8. 6. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 16; which ſhould Oblige us to be very Circumſpect, ſince he doth know the things that come into our Mind, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. 5. and which is ſignified (there) with reference to ſuch a Time. Thus Chriſt came down (from Heaven) in <hi>Sodom</hi>'s Day, to know the Certainty of what he heard, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 20, 21; becauſe he Then was come to Judge upon the Caſe; as he Now will, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 18. Now when poor Creatures ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judge, how VVatchfull are they, (as All at This day had need be) for fear of Aggravating their final ſentence!</p>
                  <p>13. Let us not be leſs <hi>watchfull</hi> in a Spiritual Caſe, than in a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily;
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:50213:157"/> or with reſpect unto an Earthly Intereſt. Men (of a ſober Spirit) will not Play with Edged tools: and Sin is VVounding, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30. 14: the Thought of Fooliſhneſs is (alſo) Sin, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 9. therefore take heed of Dallying with ſuch Temptations. How do men alſo <hi>watch</hi> for worldly Gain; though many to little purpoſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127. 2: now Duty is Enriching, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 18: nor will that labour be in vain, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 58: therefore take heed of letting ſlip ſuch Opportunities. Shall we be Circumſpect, whileſt in the ſight of Men, (for fear of loſing our Eſteem with them,) and not much more before the Lord? What is the Body, to the Soul? or Time, compared with Eternity? or Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to our being ſaved? ſpiritual unwatchfulneſs proceeds from Atheiſm in its Spring, and runneth at the laſt into its Ocean.</p>
                  <p>14. Tis but an Hour of Temptation, this, which Now is come upon us. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 10: and can ye not Watch One Hour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 40? Yea, This may Poſſibly be the Laſt Hour of our Preſent day; and if the ſhortneſs of Time ſhould make us <hi>weep</hi> as though we <hi>wept</hi> not, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 29, 30; let it then make us <hi>watch,</hi> (in competition with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining) as though we watched not. The time may Now be very near, when either we ſhall <hi>watch</hi> no more (if Dying in the Lord;) or not be ſo Extreamly Tempted, as we Now are. Though <hi>watchfulneſs</hi> will be a Duty to the End, yet may the Labour of that Duty be Abated toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Overcomers being made (within a while) a Pillar in Gods Temple, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 12. Nor do I doubt, but that conflicting <hi>Joſhua</hi> may be (e're long) Relieved with greater Strength, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9. or Leſs Temptations, as <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 1, 2. I dare not ſet the time; nor is it our Duty to Depend thereon: yet ſhould it Encourage us to keep <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,</hi> ſince our Salvation Now is Nearer every day than other, as is argued, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 11.</p>
                  <p>15. Let us conſider, of how great Conſequence it is, to <hi>Watch;</hi> and as Continually, ſo Now eſpecially.</p>
                  <p>1. Such will be moſt Dignified by Chriſt, at his Appearing; for he will then make them ſit down to meat, and Gird himſelf, and will come forth and ſerve them, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 37. <hi>Watching</hi> and <hi>Standing</hi> goe together, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 21. 8. which Standing is a weary poſture, and therefore ſuch ſhall Then ſit down; yea Chriſt will then ſet them, or make them ſit. <hi>Watching</hi> and <hi>Faſting</hi> goe together, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 5. yea want of Sleep requireth Meat, inſtead of Nouriſhing Reſt: therefore theſe VVatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhall ſit down to Meat. Such alſo have approved themſelves to be his Servants, by their VVatching, or VVaiting for him, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 36. therefore he Now will be Their Servant, which Maſters are not wont to be. They have been <hi>waiting</hi> with their Loyns Girt, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 35. 36.
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:50213:157"/> to keep themſelves from being VVeary: and therefore he will Gird himſelf. And though their watching hath been moſt <hi>within,</hi> yet he will then come forth and ſerve them. Yea ſuch ſhall be made Rulers over All, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 44.</p>
                  <p>2. Such do Enjoy themſelves (at Preſent) with the Beſt Advantage, (as in the Letter) both in Relation to Themſelves and Others. Perſons Awake, can Hear, and See, and have their other Senſes better exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, than if Aſleep: ſo in the Myſtery. Such are not Deluded with idle Dreams themſelves; and Pity others who Laugh more Heartily, but in their Sleep. Beauty is chiefly ſeated in the Eye, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 9. which none but Watchers can keep Open: nor can any other prevent their being ſhamed ſeveral wayes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 15. Such can perceive the Tempter at a Diſtance; and quickly clear themſelves of that Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which reſteth upon Others till they <hi>wake.</hi> And though Sleep in the Letter is Refreſhing, yet in a Spiritual ſence, thoſe are moſt Cheary who are moſt Awake. Yea ſuch are alſo in the beſt Capacity of being helpfull unto Others.</p>
                  <p>3. Such will be Forwardeſt to See and Know and Open unto Chriſt when he ſhall be revealed. Thoſe had the firſt Tydings of Chriſts Birth, who were then keeping Watch over their Flock by Night, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 8, 9. as if Chriſt had been onely born for them, <hi>v.</hi> 11. The VVatchmen upon Mount <hi>Ephraim</hi> are Firſt heard to crie, <hi>Ariſe and let us goe up to Sion, Jer.</hi> 31. 6: and <hi>Sion</hi>'s Watchmen ſhall lift up the Voice with Singing, for they ſhall ſee Eye to Eye, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 8. If <hi>Mary</hi> had not been up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Day-break, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 1. ſhe had not ſeen her Lord ſo ſoon, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 1. 8: and Early Sights of ſuch a Nature, will countervail the want of Sleep ſufficiently. Such alſo will Immediately Open to him, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 36. ſince Readineſs conſiſts in Watching: and if it be a Priviledge to be <hi>In</hi> Chriſt Firſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 7. by way of Truſting, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13. then to be Firſt <hi>with</hi> him; which is reſerved for the <hi>watchfull</hi> Ones.</p>
                  <p>4. Such will be leſs Affrighted (as in the Letter) with that Noyſe, wherewith the Old Heavens muſt paſs away, when Chriſt doth come, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 10. How did that Jaylour Tremble, when he was Frighted out of his Sleep with that tremendous Earthquake, and its Conſequents, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 26, 27, 29; who elſe would not have been ſo much Amazed; nor Others Now, (at ſuch a like Earthquake in the Myſtery,) but for their having been Aſleep. Sleep makes ſecure; Security preventeth Expectation; and unexpected Troubles are Tranſporting: thence are the Sinners in <hi>Sion</hi> ſo Afraid (at ſuch a time) becauſe ſurprized, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. 14; and that ſurprizal is the Fruit of ſlumbring. Whereas Awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened ones are in the conſtant Exerciſe both of their Senſe and Reaſon;
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:50213:158"/> or like on Army Training in the Field, who therefore are not ſo Affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly alarmed, as when Aſleep in their reſpective Quarters. The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt ones in former times, have been leaſt Terrified with thoſe Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions which have betrayed Others into Enſnaring Fears, by reaſon of their unwatchfulneſs.</p>
                  <p>5. Such are moſt likely to Eſcape; ſince Watchers are counted <hi>worthy,</hi> in that regard, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 36. The Cen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l (with Men) is in the Front of Danger from an Enemy; but Chriſt bids, ſave the <hi>Watchman,</hi> as having delivered his <hi>own</hi> ſoul at leaſt, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 9. Yea Chriſt will not Come (as an Adverſary) upon Watchers; who onely threatens his Coming as a Thief, in caſe men do not watch, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 3: nor could the Devil much infeſt us, if we did Fire at him when he firſt appeareth, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 7. However, <hi>watchers</hi> are beſt able to defend themſelves; whileſt ſleeping Crocodiles are apt to be deſtroyed by an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Rat. Next unto Death Sleep is the greateſt Leteller; or that which maketh All to be Alike: Yea <hi>waking</hi> Infants are more ſelf relieving than a ſlumbring Giant. If ſome had not been faſt Aſleep, the Enemy had not ſown his Tares, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 25; nor had ſhe loſt her Living Child, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3. 20. nor <hi>Siſera</hi> his Life, <hi>Judg.</hi> 4. 21; nor <hi>Sampſon</hi> both his Hair and Eyes, <hi>Judg.</hi> 16. 19. 21; nor would the good man's Houſe be Broken through, if he had watched, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 39.</p>
                  <p>6. Such will be in the beſt Capacity to entertain whatever may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall, in way of Tryal. Sleep maketh Tender; but Watchers are more Hardy; and Holieſt ones have alway been the braveſt ſufferers. A waiting ſervant (well Employ'd) cares not how ſoon his Maſter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but Ecchoeth preſently unto his Knock. Such are Aware of what is coming; and being Provided for Tribulations, that ſort of Gueſts are not ſo troubleſome as if they had been unexpected. Chriſt dreaded not the Devils coming, becauſe he could find Nothing in him, for he had been Obedient, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 30, 31: and he whoſe Courſe is finiſhed in ſuch a way, need not be frighted with the News of his Depaiture, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 6, 7. None know's how ſoon that Day may come, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14. 2. and Then, wo be to ſpiritual ſleepers, who poſſibly may be Awakened with a Sword or Piſtoll, and be run through before they can Repent. However, we daily hear of ſome or other ſtruck with ſuddain Death; whoſe Caſe may be our Own; and Bleſſed then is he that watcheth and is Ready.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude this Exhortation to be Watchfull, with ſome few Helps; which are, as followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Helps:</hi> 1. Let us be throughly Wakened out of a Preſent Sleep: 'tis but a folly (elſe) to talk of future Watching. Sleep in a Moral
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:50213:158"/> ſence, is called Death, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 14. and Watching is an Act of one Alive; till Men be therefore Quickned by Awaking, they cannot mind this work of Watching. Such alſo muſt be throughly wakened; elſe will they quickly ſleep again, when once the ſtartling Rouzer is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 13. Now, all will readily confeſs their having been Aſleep, of Later Times; But if they be more ſleightily Awakened, they will ſoon Nod again. Overly Convictions, and Gentle ſelf-repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> are wont to end in ſad Relapſes; nor is he to be Truſted for the Future, who is not deeply ſenſible of former Failings. Men un-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced cannot watch, becauſe they are Aſleep: And Men not duly Humbled (for their ſin) will ſleep again, becauſe They are not Through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wakened. Make your awakening ſure, one way or other, as you would not be over-taken with a Second Sleep.</p>
                  <p>2. Take heed of being Alone, in way of ſinful Choice, which is a woſul Diſadvantage, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 4. 10. but get into ſome kind of Body; and which is Competible unto ſcattered ones: Diſperſed ones cannot be in an Inſtituted Body ſtrictly taken; but ſuch may be Together, as thoſe Diſciples were, before the Spirits pouring out, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 33. and which is an Awakening Help. Such may Pray each with other, as They did, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 14. if Prayer be not ſome way hindred, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. and Prayer is an Awakening Exerciſe, which therefore is oft joyned with VVatching, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 36. <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 18. Such alſo may ſpeak oft one to another, as <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 16. and by that means may keep each other waking: Yea, where that Body is, there will the Eagles be, in way of Feeding, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 37. and ſeldom do Men ſleep whilſt they are Eating. Nay, Fellow-Captives may watch over one another, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> did, though in a Larger ſence, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 7. and Exerciſe ſome kind of Common Cenſures, which needs muſt be Awakening.</p>
                  <p>3. Make Choice of your Companions though; elſe had one better be Alone: ſince ſleep is as Infectious as the Plague, and in a Spiritual ſence more Dangerous. In caſe Two lie Together, they have Heat, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 4. 11. ſuppoſing them both to be Alive; but elſe a dead Log (in Bed) is not ſo Cold as a Dead Body is. I am perſwaded, ſome find it an Advantage to them, (at leaſt no Loſs) to be Diſcharged of their Old Companions; and not without ſufficient cauſe, which is the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Caſe. If you would know the Neweſt Faſhion, then go to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of this Generation: But whither ſhall one go to find a Savoury Spirit, a Spirit ſavouring what is of God? Let one begin to tell a ſtory, (or ſtart ſome Idle Curioſity; and then he may have Talk enough: but ſerious Communications ſhut Men's Mouths, if not their Eyes. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>
                     <pb n="312" facs="tcp:50213:159"/> in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 15. and <hi>Peter</hi> in the High-Prieſt's Hall, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 72. had quickly Learn'd their Late Companions Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: Yea, <hi>Barnabas</hi> was thereby much in Danger, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
                  <p>4. As Men would not be over come with ſleep, ſo let them take heed of ſlumbring, the Latter of which is but an In-let to the Former; as all the Virgins have Experienced, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 5. <hi>Eve</hi> was Beguiled, by her Parleying with the Serpent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 1, 2. and fell in Love with the Forbidden Fruit, by Looking on it, <hi>v.</hi> 6. therefore <hi>Job</hi> made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with his Eyes, <hi>Job</hi> 31. 1. One ſtick will drop out after another, in caſe the Binder be Relaxed; and therefore we ſhould rather wedge more in, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. ſince our beſt Duty (like Green Wood) is apt to ſhrink, and ſo to ſlacken. A Tender Conſcience is a precious Mercy, and a great preſervative; whilſt others of a Bolder Spirit, are oft-times caught before they are aware. The Nearer that Duty is, the better is its Beauty ſeen: But ſin's Deformity is beſt diſcerned at a Diſtance, or when it is quite out of ſight, as to a Carnal Eye. When once a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin hath loſt her ſhame, the Tempter grows thereby more Impudent; and ſinful Dallyings will enfeeble Holy Baſhfulneſs, which being Loſt, the Soul lies open to more Groſs Temptations.</p>
                  <p>5. Take heed of ſhutting out the Light, ſince Darkneſs doth Invite to ſlumber. VVhen Perſons have a mind to ſleep, they ſhut their Eyes, and draw the Curtains cloſe; ſince Light (though but Reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Glaſs) would keep them waking. Thence ſinners are ſo faſt aſleep, becauſe they are the Children of the Night; which Children of the Day are not ſo wont to be, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 5, 6, 7. Yea, thence it is, that Day-time is oft turned into Night; and Children of the Day will ſleep, in ſuch a Caſe; who therefore ſhould take heed of that Temptation. They who Rebel againſt the Light, are ſuch who alſo will commit the works of Darkneſs, <hi>Job</hi> 24. 13, 14. There are Two greater Moral Lights (as well as Natural) <hi>viz.</hi> that of the Firſt and Second <hi>Adam;</hi> both which are Lovingly to be received, and with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto their freſh Appearances. Though Nature's Light is but like that of the Moon, the letting in whereof doth not ſo much diſturb the Sleeper, as doth that of the Sun; thence may one ſleep, and yet be Morally Obedient: And Mid-day Light is moſt Awakening; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take heed of ſhutting out more High Diſcoveries.</p>
                  <p>6. Take heed of being in ſome kind of Poſture which doth betray into a ſlumbring Diſpoſition; as in the Letter, ſo in the Myſtery. As ſitting (in a Bodily Reſpect) expoſeth unto ſleeping, in the Letter: So doth the want of being well Employed, in a Myſtical ſence. Sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are therefore bidden to Ariſe, and to be Going, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 46. that
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:50213:159"/> being likelieſt to keep them waking. And the more Spiritual that any Duty is, the more are ſleep-inviting poſtures to be ſhunned: Therefore we do not Read of Sitting in that Duty of Prayer (ſave in that private Soliloquy, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 18.) but either Standing or Kneeling; which is upon Record for our Inſtruction, ſave where good Reaſon warranteth ſome other Poſture. However Sitting; in the Myſtery (or any kind of Idleneſs whatever,) doth very much prejudice one's being watchful. Perſons (in Bed together) quickly Talk themſelves aſleep; but if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's being up at work, doth keep us waking, much more if we our ſelves are ſo in Action.</p>
                  <p>7. As Drunkenneſs and ſleep are joyned together, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 7. ſo is Sobriety and VVatching, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 7. with reference to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Influence. Full fed <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> ſlept at <hi>David</hi>'s Door, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 8. And he that Tarryeth at the Wine, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 30. will fall aſleep upon a Maſt, <hi>v.</hi> 34. So will Profeſſors do, when growing ſenſual, as to their Bodily or Spiritual Diet. 'Tis not Men's Uſing of this World, but their Abuſing it, which is forbidden, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 31. as Men are not Diſtempered by their having great ſtore of Wine and Meat before them, but by their taking in too much thereof into themſelves. I never yet ſaw too Liberal Feeders upon Creature-comforts to be the choiceſt Chriſtians: Nor can it be Expected; ſince Love (in an intenſe degree) cannot be fixed upon the Father and the World at once, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 15. Yea, they who are too Dainty toothed, in a Spiritual ſence, (or who take more than is their ſhare of Spiritual Comforts) have been Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be leſs Watchful than ſome others, who take what is convenient for them, and no more.</p>
                  <p>8. The want of Due Reſt Occaſions Drouzineſs, when one ſhould Watch and be at Work. The Cares of this Life are over-charging, as well as Surfeiting; both which Occaſion ſleeping, and ſo Chriſt's Day doth come upon Men unawares, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 34. God teacheth his the Vanity of Diſtracting Care, and ſo he giveth his Beloved Reſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127. 2. Yea, he ſo keepeth them Awake in Spiritual Exerciſes, Whereas ſelf-over-ſetting VVorkers all the week, are uſually the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Lords-day ſleepers; and they who will be Rich, cannot avoid Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of a ſinful Nature, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 9. As VVorldlineſs hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Profeſſors, ſo have they let their Duty Fall, which (whilſt they were Awake, and not ſo Earthly minded) was held faſt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10. So let your Hands be Exerciſed with the VVorld, as that your Hearts may (through Believing) be at Reſt; elſe will you Nod in better Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes. Yea, they who cannot mind their Duty, without ſollicitouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs about Events, or being too buſie in what concerns another, are thereby oft betrayed into ſlumbring, for want of Reſt in its due Time and Place.</p>
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:50213:160"/>
                  <p> 9. They who are Heavy-headed (and would keep Awake) muſt not be apt to be Offended with a Friendly Nip, or being Joſtled, and ſometimes Prickt or Trod upon; at leaſt-wiſe Touched, and more ſhrilly ſpoken to. Some are too Proud to be Reproved; and others too ſelf-loving to Offend them: Thence is the Generality ſo faſt aſleep, till Chriſt himſelf doth come, or ſend to waken them. Some muſt be vexed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they will unfold their ſluggiſh Arms; and let them Fight with their Awakeners for a while, rather than ſleep the ſleep of Death. Chriſt trod upon the People's Toes, till ſome cryed out, <hi>He had a Devil,</hi> John 10. 20. and <hi>Peter</hi> prickt his Hearers to the Heart, who then Awakened, and called him Brother, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. whom formerly they had Abuſed, <hi>v.</hi> 13. When apt to be Offended with ſome Rougher handling, let every one conſider there may be much of God in ſuch a Portion, and in a way of Mercy to mine heavy-headed Soul. I could ſing Requiem's (as well as others) or ſmoother things, and thereby gain poor Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren's Love: But let me rather Rouze them with a Faithful Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, than Rock and Flatter them into a Sleep.</p>
                  <p>10. Offer ſome kind of Holy Violence unto your ſelves; as in ſuch caſes (in the Letter) Men are wont to do; not onely by ſtanding up, but ſhaking off an Heavy Diſpoſition. True Godly Sorrow worketh Indignation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11. and when a Man is vexed with his ſin unto a ſelf-abhorring, <hi>Job</hi> 42. 6. his Eye is Opened, <hi>v.</hi> 5. and will not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſhut again. Chafe in upon your Hearts ſome Rouzing Terrors, as well as Comforts; ſo will you keep your ſelves Awake, and Others too, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 8, 9, 10, 11. I have Obſerved, where ſome lye Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Now, in whom the Old Man hath prevailed to a ſelf-indulging; or who have been afraid of giving him one Angry word. Did we firſt (alway) ſpeak unto our ſelves, and Labour to make Convictions Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful upon our Conſciences, it would Awaken them, which elſe will ſleep the more ſecurely, becauſe of ſleightineſs in ſerious Matters. This ſome can Recommend, as <hi>Eliphas</hi> did his Counſel unto <hi>Job; Loe, we have ſearched it, and ſo it is; hear it, and know Thou it, for thy Good,</hi> Job 5. 27.</p>
                  <p>11. Buſie your ſelves with ſomething of a Curious and ſtirring Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Elſe Ordinary work may not prevent a Spiritual Nodding. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Engaged in ſome Deep Diſcourſe, (which calls for ſtudy, and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth up Affections,) are not ſo apt to Talk themſelves aſleep, as others are. Coldneſs in Arguing for the Truth, (proceeding from Indifferency) is very prejudicial unto Zeal in Practice: whereas a Lively Advocate doth Heat himſelf, and thereby is the more Inflamed with Love unto his Cauſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 26, 27. There are deep things of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10. and Myſteries of the Kingdom, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 11. which he who rightly
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:50213:160"/> ſtudieth, is not ſo likely to come ſhort in Leſſer Matters. <hi>Paul</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to attain the Reſurrection of the Dead, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 11. that kept him waking; whilſt he that Fancieth his being laid in ſufficiently, will ſay, <hi>Soul, take thine Eaſe,</hi> Luke 12. 18, 19. They who care not for Going on, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1. may fall Aſleep; yea, quite away, <hi>v.</hi> 6. becauſe of Reſting in Old Received things, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2. or that which is ſhort of Perfection: which Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> Reſolved to take heed of, if God permitted, <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>12. Take heed of Worldly ſorrow, which made the Diſciples ſleep, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 45. Now, let the Cauſe be what it will, immoderate ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row becometh Worldly, and that works Death, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10. which ſinful ſleep is oft-times called. <hi>Job</hi>'s Grief was very Great, <hi>Job</hi> 2. 13. and that betray'd him into a ſinful Paſſion, <hi>Job</hi> 3. 1. and <hi>Baruch</hi> Faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his ſighing, <hi>Jer.</hi> 45. 3. that made him ſeek great things at ſuch a Time, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. And they who (in the Creatures preſence) can Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, as if they had Rejoyced not, will alſo (in its Abſence) Weep ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; and by that means be kept awake. <hi>Jonah</hi> was therefore An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4. 9. (with reference unto his withering Gourd,) becauſe he had been ſo Exceeding Glad whilſt it continued, <hi>v.</hi> 6. who thereupon did ſinfully wiſh for Death, <hi>v.</hi> 8. and Juſtified it before the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>v.</hi> 9. Yea, they who do inordinately Delight in Choiſer Priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, (ſuch as Chriſt's Bodily Preſence was with his Diſciples,) may ſoon Ditt up their Eyes with ſuch a kind of dirty Tears, as ſome do Now, becauſe he Tarrieth: which alſo holdeth True, with reference to any Priviledges whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>13. Labour to be more Spiritual; ſince in Relation to this work of VVatching, the Spirit is willing, but the Fleſh is weak, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 41. Angels are Spirits, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 7. who therefore do not ſleep, but alway Behold the Face of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 10. ſo will it be with Saints, (both in a Natural and Moral ſence) as they grow more like unto Heavenly Angels. The firſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s utmoſt is called Fleſh, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 17. and Legal things are termed Carnal, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10. Yea, ſo are alſo Babes in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 1. and theſe are weak, or likelieſt to fall in Spiritual Watching. Nature skills not of Inſtituted Duty, nor yet a Legal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, of what is Evangelical; both which are therefore apt to fall, in thoſe Reſpective caſes: And Babes (in Chriſt) are very prone to ſleep and fall, as Children, in the Letter are. The Cry is Now, <hi>All Fleſh is withering Graſs, and all the Goodlineſs thereof is as a fading Flower; but the Word of our God ſhall ſtand for ever,</hi> Iſa. 40. 6, 7, 8. and by which Word is meant what is of a Proper Goſpel-Nature, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 24, 25. and therefore, as Men would ſtand in ſuch a day (or as they would not fall aſleep,) ſo let them Labour to be Spiritual and Evangelical.</p>
                  <pb n="316" facs="tcp:50213:161"/>
                  <p> 14. Get well Acquainted with the Time, which being known, is much awakening, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 11. and inability to Diſcern its ſigns, is that by which an Hypocrite is to be known, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 3. And though we ſhould be ſober, (in point of Peremptory ſetting ſuch a time,) yet let us take heed of ſaying, <hi>the Lord Delays his Coming,</hi> Mat. 24. 48. conſidering what ſinful Temptations that will Expoſe unto, <hi>v.</hi> 49. Moſt talk of ſome great Revolution near at hand; which if they ſeriouſly did believe, it would awaken them into a ſuitable watching. VVould ſome Men Beautifie their Old defiled Temples with ſuch goodly ſtones, did they fore-ſee their being ſoon to be demoliſhed, <hi>Mark</hi> 13. 1, 2? Or did they look (e're long) for New Created Heavens, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 17? VVould others fill their Houſes with ſuch dear-bought gain, did they believe their being Rifled, now within a while, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14. 2? VVould others dally with their groſs Temptations, were they aware, how ſoon all ſinners now may periſh by the Sword, <hi>Amos</hi> 9. 10? I am not poſitive, as to the very Time; but ſuch a ſtudy might keep men waking: and though Grace turneth upon Golden hinges, or Nobler Motives than Mercenary Hope, or ſlaviſh Fear, yet may theſe help to prick us out of ſleeping. And this indeed is Chriſt's own Motive here, to make us watch, becauſe we know not how ſoon he may Thus come, in theſe our Days.</p>
                  <p>15. Let us be much in Prayer, which Duty we are bid to watch unto, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 7. and to be Converſant about, together with our watching, as we would not be led into Temptation, <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 28. Prayer carrieth a Soul into Chriſt's Preſence; and whilſt he was with his Diſciples, he would not ſuffer them to ſleep, at leaſt not long. And if He doth not keep, the VVatchman waketh but in vain, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127. 1. therefore let us engage him (by our Prayer) to watch over us, as he Obligeth us (by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand) to watch our ſelves. But let us alſo watch unto Prayer in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, not Tempting him (by our neglect) who will take no Man's work out of his hand, and who will not Relieve an Idle Beggar. Thus let us VVatch and Pray, and Pray and VVatch; this is to be at work with Both our Hands, which is the likelieſt way to Overcome.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thus have I now done with this whole Parable, which hath Occaſioned my walking in untrodden paths, and wherein ſome may poſſibly have ſtumbled; whom I would onely wiſh to Weigh the Premiſes, before they do reject them. And having now born my Teſtimony, I ſhall endeavour to ſtand upon my Watch, and ſee what I ſhall Anſwer, when I am Reproved: Submitting all my Sober Apprehenſions unto Clearer Light, and Providential Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations in God's Valley of Deciſion.</hi>
